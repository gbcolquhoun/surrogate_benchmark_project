thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
just over it .
thank you .
great trick ?
thank you .
... not yet .
that &apos;s us .
here it is .
i &apos;m tom .
yeah . okay .
they need time .
it &apos;s hard .
1.5 million .
that &apos;s not ...
it &apos;s fast .
are they all ?
and he says ...
thank you .
we were poor .
seattle ...
music as a language .
it &apos;s interesting .
after a week .
stop twice .
we love innovation .
that &apos;s wrong .
we know that .
ta-da !
a few less .
solar is ...
what does that mean ?
that &apos;s singing .
oh my god .
yes , hello .
what does that mean ?
home where ?
i can help .
we pick it up .
a lot .
does that sound good ?
but it &apos;s there .
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know .
we love entertainment .
it &apos;s not happening .
we lose them .
oh my god !
it &apos;s terrible .
thank you . thank you .
three out of 10 .
the only opportunity .
it was incredible .
long , yeah .
stephen watt .
the sun rises up .
fantastic , right ?
yeah , so , in a sense .
thank you .
no hospital .
pour them .
what a fish .
that &apos;s me even .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s it .
wonderful , isn &apos;t it ?
and she did .
they &apos;re all important .
completely inefficient .
that &apos;s efficient .
not very sustainable .
it &apos;s essential .
very different term .
so they meet al .
incredibly exciting .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
what did they do ?
ban is blank .
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
a few more .
it &apos;s a crisis .
he opens the door .
so they knew everything .
1,000 , very good .
good job ! yes !
that &apos;s great .
the farm is incredible .
it was fascinating .
that &apos;s it .
so what do you say ?
robert gupta .
what happened here ?
thank you very much .
sounds familiar , what ?
why no longer live longer ?
they have similar principles .
oh , so the one .
hey , why not ?
this is our present .
this is the system .
you could see manhattan .
this was the result .
there &apos;s no normal .
centers were built .
just make your job .
i &apos;m all interested in this .
what happened here ?
lento , slowly .
yeah , good afternoon .
yeah , good afternoon .
and that &apos;s important .
can i be honest ?
but you know what ?
it &apos;s got sensors .
we can do that .
what was the result ?
here &apos;s the video .
yeah , millions of seconds .
but you know what ?
evaluate it .
that &apos;s very good .
the whole environmental discussion .
these people deserve money .
yeah , i know .
i don &apos;t know .
they use their hands .
why do we do that ?
flying cat .
and it &apos;s got to go back .
it &apos;s not a country .
this is a wish .
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
i don &apos;t think so .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
i have a question .
how do we know that ?
and i was an artist .
because you know what ?
yeah , that &apos;s it .
we can do it differently .
so how does this work ?
let &apos;s call it don &apos;t .
how interested they are .
what do these people need ?
can we change it ?
these days are over .
bg : thank you .
not school management .
this is the last one .
you can go inside .
so it &apos;s true .
so where do we go ?
that would have been okay .
i thought about it .
what are media today ?
so let &apos;s see .
here &apos;s an example .
so they can do that .
they bad . &quot;
i was faced with him .
players don &apos;t sit around .
and i kept working .
okay . thank you .
this is what &apos;s happening to us today .
so she was back .
oh . a moment .
what do you want to do ?
i want to tell you .
or bombs .
we need energy miracle .
why does that happen ?
i go in here .
there are two options .
but i kept working .
not toxic in there .
you can see it immediately .
thank you .
why should we do that ?
he &apos;s not going to do that .
it feels great .
i wonder .
thank you for listening .
they even hurt .
i swear it .
i promise children .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m a writer .
it &apos;s against justice .
jk : both .
first of all , limited .
maybe 10 times as many .
be a mentor .
imagine the camera .
again , my gut feeling .
but the wrong things .
thank you very much .
after just a journey there .
yeah . all right . good .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
here you can see it .
an enormous challenge .
the data came in .
what creates the illusion ?
and so it was .
i created one .
here &apos;s another example .
but it didn &apos;t .
there &apos;s no food .
people played crazy .
but it gets worse .
it keeps you fresh .
he liked him very much .
anyone see something specific ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
good afternoon , everybody together .
and then it became international .
let me summarize it .
there &apos;s an old study .
there are online criminals .
he always showed up there .
that &apos;s a great question .
some have come and gone .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
there were remixes .
here you can see the city .
in china , it was different .
here &apos;s another example .
i agree with you .
dk : 60,000 .
luckily , right ?
that &apos;s a great question .
and then it happened again .
it &apos;s not our problem .
but that &apos;s not an protection .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
is it any photography at all ?
okay , a few more .
i mean the soul .
there &apos;s something else .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
very expensive real estate .
yeah , here it is .
the answer to that is no .
and it got better .
just further . a lot of fun .
crisis . death . disaster .
uh-huh .
that &apos;s what she did .
we lost touch .
it would be intractable .
he had the experience .
and why is that ?
you put comparison in comparison .
an almost identical structure .
and i always had that .
give pee a chance .
we have three main groups .
i felt really good .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
did you see these guys ?
i think rather than that .
what would it have to be done ?
they were still fish .
and many people forget this .
it has billions of them .
am i going to like color ?
my name is amit .
privacy needs to be given .
ooh , thank you .
is that your mind ?
who will make it safe ?
it &apos;s called paul offit .
they look like this .
don &apos;t be kidnapped .
that &apos;s the short census .
the work of interpreting .
it &apos;s not true of emotions .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
but where are we useful ?
so , what does that mean ?
let &apos;s also call him don &apos;t .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only country in the world .
how do we actually work ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
so what happened years after that ?
i grew up in india .
but what do your fish eat ?
and luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
the game is from 2007 .
i had good life .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i don &apos;t like that question .
so what did she believe ?
this is preconceivable .
i was devastated .
well , what does that mean ?
is it about light ?
... inventing his own story .
i &apos;ll stop that .
first , we have the population .
you can see the water coming .
who are these relatives ?
i want to ask you something .
we have to spread the message .
you can see that down there .
you also have to understand that .
why not think about that ?
what do i look at ?
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
we love technology and creativity .
he went up and down .
his name is tempt .
but what do we do with this ?
will it have my size ?
it &apos;s kind of like this .
we &apos;re always bumping each other .
it sounds crazy , right ?
most of you know this .
i actually made two mistakes .
and this opens up a map .
it would be unknowable .
so what do we have to do ?
this is felix .
it &apos;s created by conflicts of creativity .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or is it possible ?
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
so we &apos;re too many .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
we were 20 people .
it may sound bad .
you can &apos;t have a bone .
i &apos;ll end by now .
this is what the chart looked like .
what else can we do ?
what &apos;s the soul ?
i can say everything .
we no longer produce ourselves .
very scary .
they called me up .
overlegends technology .
but i felt worse .
these changes are coming .
the orange tractor .
that &apos;s the exciting one .
but the key thing is , ...
what about fitness ?
it works like this .
and then they set up .
and it &apos;s nothing at all .
what actually happened ?
one is south korea .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
they really loved it .
same thing , only bigger .
well , i was next .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
let &apos;s face it -- who is normal ?
again , you have it again .
so why is it that hacking now ?
and ultimately , epic meaning .
this is from this place .
that was the beginning of the journey .
first extension , second .
you want to feed the world ?
they connected these two people .
my wife told me .
but it was very sad .
what is this for a thing ?
they could have done better .
and this is the crux .
but they do the job .
it &apos;s very risky .
does it make it curious ?
and how did that feel ?
and it worked very well .
because you can train that .
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
i wanted to support them .
sometimes i push too much .
and then everybody went down .
i handed awe .
her mother moved her alone .
like that , you know .
who is most successful ?
tell me about this world .
i see this plusb sign .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
this is sort of a natural thing .
thank you for your attention .
this is what happened around christmas .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
they saw the big impact .
and it took 18 months .
think about your own decisions .
so it &apos;s circle .
i just loved two .
it shares her experience with others .
well , then we want to .
it &apos;s not a problem at all .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say that .
the answer is no .
it was a huge success .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
is that reasonable ?
the data was not available before .
how many people would choose creativity ?
the other thing to do is to work .
it was my first sunburn .
and there are hundreds of them .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
you can have these clouds .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
the power plant can explode .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
that made me really sad .
they always say , &quot; why ? &quot;
what happened that day ?
everybody is talking about happiness today .
people were still happy .
so let me remind you .
they come from the artists .
she was back and die .
now , how could this happen ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
but it &apos;s not that fast .
this is a game out there .
i learned everything .
anyone know what that is ?
and he showed him hunt .
for example , this perception in context .
so that &apos;s the good news .
2.5 to one , great .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
she did it for three years .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
so they saw something magical .
play is not silly .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
in fact , he gathered fish .
no one had ever been an opportunity .
so we can .
how can we help you ? &quot;
is this all about education ?
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and there &apos;s good news .
my name is brian goldman .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the story is not over .
but there are two problems .
and it was an incredible experience .
so it &apos;s not like detox .
no one has ever said that before .
the whole building was made of water .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
what should our testimony look like ?
but , you know what ?
they can play with different ways .
they create an epic story .
everybody needs a gold fish glass .
basically , they do the same thing .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what other brands act like that ?
the white lines are for population .
play is not just child games .
and that &apos;s what we did .
and he actually says that way .
and then something weird happened .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible .
they have so much uncertainty .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
i talk a lot about these questions .
this was an awesome thing .
the data is constantly illuminating .
and that &apos;s what we pick up .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
and this was 19 years ago .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well either .
italy wins . yeah .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
let &apos;s be blue i . &quot;
that &apos;s it , very simple .
so paul is a terrorist .
which one would you like most ?
and right now , the garbage is garbage .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
i almost never cook it .
in the morning , before the game .
i started feeling better .
an autistic student .
so this is one of the images .
we went to an area .
and again , this is the representation .
we depend on two countries .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
it &apos;s just not technological .
he pointed at the algae .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and then realizing it .
it &apos;s not supposed to be suffering from other things .
and they already have a problem .
somehow , the kids aren &apos;t doing anymore .
so the question is : how ?
what have we learned ?
once we started a vivid thing .
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
they &apos;re going to be free to computers .
because is there any masses here ?
every waste is nutrient .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we all love baseball , right ?
and we &apos;re too many .
this has the biggest impact .
my second mistake was worse .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
and the shape plays a role .
slowly but surely , it was .
they can &apos;t store energy .
then i can transmit this whole thing .
we &apos;re not going to go on than that .
what do they try to do ? &quot;
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
it doesn &apos;t work , isn &apos;t it ?
okay , that &apos;s really what makes it really audacious .
we use the energy of the sun .
this is all metadata .
and it starts with a doctor .
it &apos;s going to be more and more like that .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
because i can say everything .
maybe even in our cell phones .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
the nurse asked the nurse .
creativity kind of had to get out .
it &apos;s all easy to have today .
i really wanted to act normal back then .
i got a little scared of technology .
so i went to the court .
once the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t do it easy .
this is what i &apos;m going to show you now .
that sounds frightening .
hmmm , my brand ?
that &apos;s scary .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
next , nuclear power .
let &apos;s leave that quiet .
but it &apos;s very effective , right ?
it &apos;s completely ubiquitous .
thank you for your patience .
what else is risky ?
so i tried something exciting .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
just be who you are .
their family gathered together .
i remember my first fire .
but we need that in total .
dark urine . dark .
nullemissions , right ?
what &apos;s a story about ?
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
the reasons to write it .
i &apos;m going to shoot through my head .
so , look what happens .
anyway , not to navigate .
why did i go to medicine ?
otherwise , you can &apos;t have teeth .
all adults were aware of the risks .
have you been neither ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
so the correlation is low .
the truth is more like this .
the game begins -- silence .
do you want to solve jeans ?
it &apos;s like talking .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
so i just started playing .
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
it &apos;s not being documented .
so you can &apos;t solve that at all .
and this video is real time .
i like things that are different .
and that &apos;s the beginning .
and this really changed the dynamics .
i went to jail -- hard .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
they sell certificates .
what about longevity ?
because to me , it means memory .
it didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and i &apos;ve never seen it before .
and then we said , &quot; okay .
it &apos;s expanding rapidly .
how and what did he feel ?
it can know where we are .
this is a child &apos;s game , right ?
we say sustainability in germany .
and you know what i learned ?
but what will happen in the future ?
this is an image of the object .
you know what neither is neither ?
this is a pretty crazy idea .
you can see something funny here .
anyone know what three seconds are ?
it &apos;s got to be the age of age .
i &apos;m not going to take the same process .
you can show , i was there .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
i think it &apos;s imperative .
do we really want to go this way ?
they were genetically expressed .
music is medicine . music changes us .
he &apos;s still able to use his eyes .
these will be inconsistent .
i could draw . i could paint .
so the first step to an interpretation .
something was increasing in me .
oh , my time is over ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
this picture reminded me of something .
i &apos;m the redefined doctor .
privacy is not the debate .
because we live on a planet .
but there &apos;s another reason .
i really like beautiful clothing .
and there are several reasons for this .
lego made it possible for everyone .
we started this 15 years ago .
we can regain our nutrients .
in the presumption of maybe two percent .
and it &apos;s still no interpretation .
it turns out to be really difficult .
how far do you get there ?
and these are the neural structures .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
anyway , we need a solution .
when you get to that , right ?
you can do it all the time .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
so we measured his movement .
and that can make a big difference .
but the truth is far away .
it seemed to be pretty popular .
on the book and the image .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
so i stop , thank you very much .
that &apos;s the minimum .
it has nothing to do with science .
they flooded the channels .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
five million people use it every month .
but it requires a lot of planning .
it makes leukemia in children .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
we didn &apos;t have a cent year .
now we &apos;re going to do this with airplanes .
okay , you really want to know that ?
now i see greg lemond .
i fell in love with this fish .
the defeat would have been too simple .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
i want to prove that to you .
here he leaves the sun .
who would ever want one ?
and every morning , i &apos;ll jump to that .
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
he was over the course of six .
that was more emphasis .
it &apos;s a very sensitive question .
it was a pretty fake project .
this is the memory .
and this sounds very different than before .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
but then you really want to go in .
and the goal here is very simple .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
and i had to go out of the city .
here &apos;s her march line .
her father died shortly after birth .
i started with my usual talk .
you want to orient at the museum ?
so this crazy story could be true .
we won some prizes .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
i hold the knife in my hand .
no , i mean it &apos;s really serious .
our magazines are read by millions .
i turn my sleeve back .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
it &apos;s supposed to fill the experience .
to take these rivers rapidly .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
i learned this from my grandmother .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
a billion people are starving today .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
the stones are colorcoded .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
it &apos;s about changing standards .
a has these benefits and risks .
we need to think about what brands are .
my brother started me .
who do you really want to inform it ?
we can reinvent it all the time .
bjordan .
very simple , that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to come .
risk is not a simple game .
and it brought me together like this .
they even bring money to funding .
often in the third , they forget about it .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
it &apos;s about shiny .
i call this the bright tiger .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
who could have all this anticipated ?
it &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
oh my god . oh my god .
we already have a lot of procedures .
we &apos;ve been playing since 1994 warcraft .
and it depends on phosphorus .
this is ideology , not science .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
i started an institute on this .
so the natural things are presented .
this may be broadly transmitted .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
these are the apsaras .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
for longer than these other two networks .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
i talked a lot about magic .
the hot projectors today .
the film was not delivered yet .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
it &apos;s automatically running into the right thought .
as we think from north .
they gave rise to blood pressure .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
the result was catastrophic .
happy productivity . fantastic !
thank you , but the best part is coming .
and everyone in this room has to go into it .
we &apos;ve achieved a kind of balance .
and nobody seems to be upset about that .
people about the urine .
the living fees the spirits .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
in terms of words , would you describe ban ?
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i don &apos;t know who sees .
there are also worlds .
asking , what is the right thing ?
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
they get very good .
i tried to understand it .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds .
and for energy , this one came up with me .
and here you feel it .
the students are divided up after notes .
these things are logically accurate .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
they &apos;re interested in fire .
and he signed up there .
here you have this little mechanism .
let &apos;s make a little bit of interference .
tell what you feel .
completely focused on a particular goal .
he died , broken by history .
this is how the building works .
you lose rare animals .
they drilled through each other .
she &apos;s going to deeply touch her .
they kept us inspired by being inspired .
i represent people in death cells .
i hope you forgive me .
that i &apos;d written these crazy things .
they brought their pictures with me , right ?
i think it &apos;s really cool .
let &apos;s start with perceiving .
now we saw the reverse effect .
so there are two circles that are occurring .
we put unique elements in here .
that sounds kind of unusual for the first time .
so this is a tough foot .
so ... does not mean that optimistic .
most of all , when he died .
it &apos;s been constant .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
so scott gets this angry .
polite , they all applauded .
now look at this curve .
so i followed my gut feeling .
they literally surrounded the lever .
perhaps lead some mutations .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
widrills simply belong to our lives .
what do you think happens next ?
we worked till late in the night .
they have them . they always have them .
the byproduct is clean water .
he pulled back to silence .
he switches off the wheels .
it may take until it &apos;s loaded .
i read you the entry .
there was jimmy kimmy kimmy .
so from modern to the computer society .
and curiosity can &apos;t learn .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we go through initiation ritual .
it &apos;s about a recovery of america .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the mechanism is from lying .
the main man came up with me .
a dalmatinker , right .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
it &apos;s not usually the route .
these are all inconvenient questions .
look at what it does .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
let &apos;s think about atoms .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
and that &apos;s what they do .
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe .
but with the right design , please .
how would you describe your brand ?
we can support them to be good .
something very strange happens here .
i &apos;m a speaker .
what are these three billion people going to bring together ?
we also got very precise data .
it was really hugely profound .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
this is the system we live in .
we can support them to be good .
and women did it successfully .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
you should want some wishes as well .
even cats look at this video .
the roof was covered with water as well .
this is a picture of a circle .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
it &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
but i continued to ask these questions .
she was not drowning .
you can see from the back to the front .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
we have to get a long way , and it &apos;s fast .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
we talk about chickens , fresh .
he shook his head , no .
i thought everybody could do that .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
we expect a couple of extraordinary decades .
this is going to happen in the next april .
they had a concept of blue blood .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re the homicide countries .
what &apos;s five to 20 million seconds ?
i see the dalma matinker .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
this is an environmental network .
anybody else knows what that is ?
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
and i want to read it to you .
and there are plenty of employees .
make it possible -- all of you here .
what &apos;s just been represented .
so it creates a feedback .
we &apos;ll go back to these people later .
daniel kahneman : sure .
and why ? genetically modified food .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
so littits open source .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
no , no , far lacks .
the chef had cooked it .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
that &apos;s kind of a tragic part .
the shore is from another place .
we &apos;ve masses now masses in this country .
they can be logical and intuitive .
i lived in parallel worlds .
and that was the outbreak of it .
so the first exciting primate .
someone made an old-fashioned version of it .
maybe i did it with a good reason .
not even the truth will release it .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
and also , these sources are interrupted .
maybe have to look at it again .
these kinds of circumstances don &apos;t exist with us .
we can give ourselves something like this .
156 nations send our television channel .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
we live in a really extraordinary time .
it &apos;s not just a call center in boston .
and even lomborg thinks about it .
the dose also plays a role .
everybody would like to make people happier .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
to say , what is information ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
you put them in that way .
it can know how we hold it .
they grow five centimeters .
it &apos;s called &quot; jump with me . &quot;
there was never been a time like this .
this is a modest little app .
there &apos;s another aspect in history .
because we don &apos;t want to shoot genes around ?
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria .
thank you , danny kahneman .
his personal impressions of the sea eroses .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
many of my clients are very young .
the guy in the middle is not that much .
a particularly beautiful story , i mean .
it &apos;s a really cool whip food .
and then he can walk away .
i have it here on my laptop . &quot;
it &apos;s got to process that as a present .
i &apos;m trying to do this by an example .
you can see the timeline up there .
here are two different jets of jewelry .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
there are some things that have to come together .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
but we start to see a change .
but it &apos;s not just words .
what they need is a new medical culture .
do you want to get there and listen ? &quot;
we get an absolutely flat line of that .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
alone , damaged and without support .
bad ? i was completely confused .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
it was an acoustic .
my cousins walked around everywhere .
this is an annual flow of water .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
they run the process , they understand it .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
i think our identity is threatened .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
the next step was happening in these communities .
it all comes from our own pockets .
as an artist , i think it &apos;s very important to me .
he had 20 minutes of glorious music .
shack the environment , make less trash .
this is just an insurance technique .
a language is the expression of the human mind .
normal people aren &apos;t accessible to these devices . &quot;
let &apos;s get something else out there .
i get tired , like all of us .
but the game is a formal transducer .
and anyway , italy won at the end .
bats are ubiquitous .
it should recontain the two elements .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything but discover .
thank you . i have a question to you .
here you can see roberto dance .
but i &apos;ll get to talk about that in a minute .
but western governments also help themselves .
and it was ecologically a disaster .
that really solves the fuel problem .
this is my supermarket . it &apos;s not a big one .
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
he had uploaded a lot of natural videos .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
thank you very much . that was incredible .
this is one , a part of it .
the difference is then perceived as a loss .
by the way , this is just the workforce .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
what are i doing application ?
no tree is carbon neutral .
does it not reach half or a quarter ? &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
so what can we conclude from all this ?
it &apos;s great that this number rises .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
so basically a translation of translation .
and further , now look at it .
so far , this was a supercomputer problem .
the emergency workers moved all the strands .
there are lots of great books on this subject .
no insurance can form .
in two hours , it &apos;s expanding everywhere .
in this three-sentence , three sentences are coming .
three set you know from school .
i want to explain that a little bit for a second .
in fact , i didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
now , the instruments have evolved .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lip pen .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum guy .
do you remember the winch again ?
monday : color is a little more powerful .
and it usually looks like this .
imagine mozart efficient .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
they make it worse than that .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
so , just help me a little bit .
i &apos;m happy i &apos;m there .
if you burn coal , no .
the amount of water has expanded .
we asked , and no one knew .
it &apos;s kind of shrinking us .
they know that science is not a company .
and the list you can continue endlessly .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
say , there &apos;s no prediction .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
second and a half time . at the end of normal play .
everybody &apos;s been eating a cake .
if you burn natural gas , no .
now , what are the archaic models ?
that &apos;s something that &apos;s built in the city .
so , this was my primate motivation .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
let me show you how they work .
you can zoom in very easily and zoom out .
maybe we can see widrilling as change .
it &apos;s not much better than that .
imagine that for a moment .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
we &apos;re thinking about energy scarcity today .
it &apos;s a game called folan .
so , that really bothered me .
can you play it in blue now ?
people suffered . people fought .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
so it &apos;s more like the norm to say .
no , we realize what &apos;s in there .
raise your hands . let me see .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
you go around and you amuse it .
restore america . find out more .
i call it &quot; the next billion . &quot;
and there &apos;s a central point .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
but it has an unexpected twist .
shack the environment , consume less energy .
you have to tell me a little bit about my brand .
third , escalation of expectations .
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
now , look at the dalma matinker .
my fourth technology : anticipating complexity .
i thought i could integrate myself .
it &apos;s not just an insane idea .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
i work in the solar industry .
i wanted to restore the health of a disease .
now , if you think a little bit further .
my parents are the 80 on the heels .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
and let me show you a simple example .
if not , someone else today .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
they just listen and they start talking .
and the two last two are here today .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
but reality is always unpredictable .
life had not changed for centuries .
i remember it was yesterday .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
my grandmother never forgotten me his life .
the official dogma of what ?
donnerday : self-confidence is the key .
we &apos;re talking about drowning into information .
i tried to maintain the body .
we forced them . puff .
it sums up a thousand square miles .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
well , i entered the courtyard .
i said , &quot; okay , oma . &quot;
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , isn &apos;t it ?
they laughed more than they do here .
you can dive in one particular year .
we reject genetic engineering food .
the three words were , remember ?
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
what ? that really freaked me out .
and there &apos;s a problem of salvation .
it was something we knew to do .
this is what &apos;s called the osia model .
but so many , over the years , we got help .
third technique : categorization .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
your problem is that you have too little .
now i &apos;m adding a bass .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
but i didn &apos;t get away from that .
intersexuality appears in many different forms .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
no one needs to green light .
the permanent ice is marked with red .
i think i may have heard more hands .
so this is how the supermarket is .
scott was talking about man to man .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s in there that &apos;s useful .
our goal was to just say , okay .
seriously -- the process goes on .
they were just like the people in this room .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
so put it on . save the shoes .
we always create new tensions and conflicts .
what do you do with certificates ?
and yeah , i &apos;ll go on a slide .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
yet , we seem to be very happy with it .
and if not , however , dance your dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
anyway , they do it in there .
so that made sense , it fit together .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and this is a million concert .
yeah , i &apos;m scared of all these things .
then he escaped me in the ear .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
and this is very important in medical research .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
eeee ! no , thank you .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
so again , the fit was really good .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
there &apos;s a lot of luck coaching .
and after that , it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
there can be a series of changes .
we need to apply for more research funds .
and here &apos;s each piece that &apos;s very well planned .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
what would you tell someone who believes that ?
let me show you from the nearest .
and amazingly , he was still delicious .
this has to go down , down to zero .
this is alfred gonzalez .
and over time , you can react to the other .
shame . shame .
is it about the details or the colors ?
that &apos;s how you can &apos;t put them all together .
all of it &apos;s composable .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
here &apos;s some on the hampton .
what we want is to create the future .
this is going to be balanced in china for a second .
my grandparents pushed this number to 70 .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
the first is a classic , apple .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
now , you &apos;re all back on your way .
picasso replies , just wait .
so two pairs , each one is a baby .
and we &apos;re constantly increasing our expectations .
and i went back to work .
now , i would normally take the needle out .
that the theme of ecology is a global issue .
storytelling always uses more and more senses .
it &apos;s the only test of survival and success .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
now i &apos;m going to do something else about this .
i was really excited about science , you know .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
this becomes a key element of this genius .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
no one in the world has ever done that way .
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
next week , this is coming to the market .
natural light then offers smart grid .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
it &apos;s the way i want to be .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we just signed up .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they live with chemosynthesis .
so i think we have to be leaders .
ladies and gentlemen , their relativity .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
i &apos;m going to choose the government .
and they had to remove what we did .
the question is why people accept it .
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle .
there &apos;s each footprint that &apos;s disadvantaged there .
and every night , they fly back 2,000 miles .
i first thought that was a game .
so we have this terrible simplistic idea .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and silicon .
what did they believe in these design students ?
it &apos;s got a button and out .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
let &apos;s pretend we have a machine here .
these things have a positive effect .
there &apos;s somebody sitting back there who had no childhood .
what &apos;s the food processing ? &quot;
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the rest of the time , they &apos;re deloccurring .
no one wanted to have something to do with the film .
and try this whole thing again with another generation .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
they fly 2,000 miles to the farm every morning .
and not only will they die of masses .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
that our contribution to the system is to choose .
and of course , it made click .
and i have to say , i &apos;ve got power .
when i was 16 , i started to illustrate books .
i start with some simple examples .
but the best part is -- in a second .
we always tried to ask meaningful questions .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
i want to show you something too first here .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
i never want to change anything in life .
do you know what it &apos;s called a 400th ?
it supports other people talk about their mistakes .
it &apos;s all over here . it &apos;s all online .
what happened is that we could do that .
&quot; great , &quot; i said , &quot; great . &quot;
why do we do that ? why do we do it ?
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers walk down .
so i spoke at a conference a few months later .
for example , the sneaker , right ?
i hired them , and i went to the treatment .
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
they don &apos;t spend time in power fights .
notice two things about this curve .
so the theme of the day : saving money .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
we want to do something about death penalty .
this is a problem that many players have .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
so smart grid , a huge issue everywhere .
i &apos;ve summarized the last three of the five .
so every concert is a different concert .
in fact , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
and we need to do much better at this device .
it came in italy four and a half years ago .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet maintain a realistic level .
and everything is packaging or content .
there are some really interesting developments .
so , don &apos;t save , quote , avoid .
it would roll over the country .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine .
he came up to me and hugged me .
i &apos;m really sorry . is it crazy ?
everybody who was like that , they started to divide .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for a second .
it was a lot of it , and i was in iron .
now everyone in this pattern is trying to see something .
we don &apos;t get identity , we invent it .
so it &apos;s supposed to get from the outside to people .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
at the beginning , the tribal society is through language .
i raised it very much here .
technical circles are the same .
anyway , that &apos;s what i want . i certainly want .
this is a dead turtle .
they reversed the flow of water .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
and in that head , the memory was playing .
and what does it look like in there ?
and i found this incredibly exciting .
we understood that weather is global .
you saw it in the news .
so , we can &apos;t make these things at all .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
this is an entirely unsustainable development pattern .
i have something here that i want to show you .
in the countries where people get money .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
store those off , delete the rest .
what would it be like to live longer in good health ?
did you take all of your vitamins this morning ?
the only thing they had was their head .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
no apple has ever melted like that .
the dna was an interesting step .
so this was a very strange experience .
and giving me feedback back to my doctor .
all these winds are all over the place , almost .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
but what happened to &quot; citizens &quot; has happened to be different .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
i want to help you calm down .
all right , what &apos;s the brand gerry ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel real money .
there were no cantaloupe-melon .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
one of the things i thought he had no bricks .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the labels .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
and we also saw this in mobile phones .
the silence is ears concrete .
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can .
the headquarters are right there .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
as i said , amanda , our elephants .
both of them are survivable , both inches .
but maybe you can still agree with them .
i remember it was yesterday .
all of this stuff is inevitable .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of conventional animals .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
so they can refer to the whole movement .
they get less rare because we start them .
there seems to be disagreement .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
here &apos;s another couple of people testing it .
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
and we see that it &apos;s made out of it .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping .
it &apos;s kind of like our campfire .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and out of me , a character in the book .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
but today , we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
i think , first of all , curiosity is .
i put my job at 95 lbs .
that &apos;s the u.s. for hundreds of years .
they absolutely didn &apos;t want to do with the project .
but how do you do that in practice ?
so every droplet was slightly different .
if you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
the answer will be extremely likely to be no .
you know , how many people look at these tedtalks ?
not everything should be composable , of course .
in our own countries , we would never do this .
here &apos;s the results we just got .
there are those who are much more spatial .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
we found that it &apos;s moving really strange .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
good night , sweet thumbs . &quot;
look , dr. kean changed his thinking .
it &apos;s hardly spoken about interpretation .
what &apos;s next thing you want to talk about .
and that worked . applause for scott .
and all of this leads us to one big question ...
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
she had the last word in every family time .
the transition happens . we can all feel it .
and in my adolescence , i said , expectation .
how could it be possible that we do that ?
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
it &apos;s sort of about a behavior poop .
and it wasn &apos;t hard to diagnose .
i was an obsessive student .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
because actually , this man is not interested in evidence .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he &apos;s just fooling you and not himself .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
... that also the doses play a role .
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
and finally , let &apos;s welcome transparency .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
we don &apos;t want to try and tell the future before .
well , i understand that . that &apos;s what i do .
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
the marshmallow needs to be on top .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
these are footage of six seconds .
and you say , what happens to these moments ?
is great , then we have a business model .
and this is the planning behind stuxnet .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
or they didn &apos;t have photographics .
all right , really good , maybe an all-star .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have anymore ?
and we use this word with such contempt .
now he &apos;s getting a tractor into the scene .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature of god .
because we can &apos;t live without that lifespan .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
wealth , not debt , affects the outcome .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
these stupid movies don &apos;t bring us money .
but it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
many of you in this room probably know this trick .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
why do i have to afford a little car like that ?
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
i want to tell you how we figured that out .
for nathaniel , music means secondary health .
designing a phrase with his own breath .
or are they more like a down-attribute ?
i can reframe the sequence as it walks .
and they also feel their movements and their tendency .
i made the decision to move into the united states .
if your job is dance , dance .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
all of this is a game , i have to say to it .
so we have 1.5 billion players in total .
thank you for being at ted . thank you .
so basically , my two passions flew .
yeah , what kind of projects do we actually do ?
she hardly breathed and was blue .
and the world we lived in .
eighteen players played the game for eight weeks .
i had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
it &apos;s nateness , and it &apos;s just nateness .
from avian age to the machine age .
all right , let me show you a little bit more about it .
here we were , and this is the painting .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
but will we make the best part of our game drive ?
this is the call center for service and information .
this is the kind of educational shame .
but one of them is much worse than the other .
we have the passion of a diy innovator .
you would expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
there were lots of crazy things going on .
now we do this with drills and machines .
emc presents &quot; welcome transparency . &quot;
we all have navigational systems in our cars .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a great loss .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
and so i then made a little unusual decision .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same with the disabled rights movement .
we want to create mass infections . &quot;
there &apos;s a link , a mutual respect .
and we want to put this on a global scale .
but you know what they &apos;re not right for ?
they virtualize reality and without computers .
i thought , well , let &apos;s bring the poker effort .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
so we walk away from it , and where do we go ?
there &apos;s a program that some of you may know .
i agree first , that &apos;s logical .
the underwater fraction comes from a quarry .
people in the side room are coming in .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
if you want to build it hyperlinks between the images .
and some of it worked and some of it didn &apos;t work .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
we wanted to design a tool for language learner .
the kid in me is really excited about these kinds of possibilities .
but now , you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
the first question is , are we really too many ?
i &apos;m going to report today about unexpected discoveries .
but you &apos;re not going to replace phosphorus .
tuesday : customization is completely overrated .
when i say reality , i mean photo-reality .
a little bit more about you that aren &apos;t you .
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
the dog ! i was linguistic .
it seems to me that it &apos;s important to unite both .
and how was that for them ? what was it successful ?
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
it was &quot; forever , &quot; forever , forever . &quot;
and it was the same after three months .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
then i say , heart sorry , right ?
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the possibilities of this yet .
you know , he was here in 1835 .
it &apos;s right , morality , patentry .
the main problem here is like aids .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about reality .
my mother suffered from the boat .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the board staff anymore .
and we &apos;re reinventing ourselves as often as we want .
have a nice example of this .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
these are the people who form my worldview .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor &apos;s need .
i &apos;m very grateful for the recommendation here .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
it &apos;s also shown in other places of the book .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
and luckily , there &apos;s a whole bunch of studies now .
and i went over and i just listened to it .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going to do ? &quot;
this player is about to be in front of an epic victory .
in each of those five areas , we need at least 100 people .
same , i think , let &apos;s use games today .
and i said , &quot; yeah , very happy . &quot;
you can say things that affect the world .
... if you could just show the slide .
probably one of those numbers has to get very close to zero .
this is how we learn trust and the rules of the game .
we actually know that something else is the case .
what we &apos;ve been left with is the story of story .
we can continue these things at different examples .
do that , and then you learn the sentence .
it &apos;s not supposed to be a joke at all , but .
the first two sentences , which are logically accurate .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about what &apos;s true .
so imagine just two different little changes .
and this is how &apos; n &apos; n &apos; em .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
how many would decide for a good memory ?
so please listen , if a music is played .
so , go ahead and start to invent it .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
this is an idea worth spreading .
it &apos;s hard to overestimate the destruction .
so you could feel like selling it .
and we can look at that now .
it &apos;s a completely denial of error .
and so my way of making films completely changed .
but what this image says is a problem .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
there are some places we can turn to .
the second factor is the services we use .
these are versatile and weird programs .
so here are some natural fireflies .
that means the ants weigh a lot more than we do .
go and queue leonard cohen .
i said , &quot; promise , oma . &quot;
because they have special skills of the processing .
his whole process has changed after that .
we called it the digital water pastorage .
you can look around in all these museums .
how much money is needed to realize that ?
loans and sponsors were chosen .
and i spent a while trying to figure that out .
think about it . this attack is generic .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
and we created an ipad app .
this is another look at the tree of life .
we didn &apos;t have a child paralysis in this country yesterday .
look , let me give you an analogy .
they moved to a natural concept .
then you &apos;ll notice that there was a change .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
i think that &apos;s true of every person on the planet .
child mortality has declined by a tenth .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
there &apos;s no overpopulation problem in trees .
so these women just met , and they just sat down .
each big picture is the beginning of a cube .
so he got the citizens to check them out .
imagine a noisy airplane .
he says , &quot; let &apos;s prepare for the record . &quot;
so we start with a windows-drone .
and the third area that actually explains itself .
they divided the kingdom into two .
&quot; look at your predators , pink .
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
i look forward to talking to all of you !
you zoomed in . you can actually go in .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
if you have something to give , now .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
they teach them to open up their doors .
so in other words , i define what i want .
we reconstructed them , repairing them .
it &apos;s growing in the winter and shrinking in summer .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and i see the same process in combining photos .
they had 348 different kinds of merchandise .
those who make scientific argument are very little .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
it was seen almost 200 million times this year .
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
this is the consequence we have to face .
or are they more like a down-attribute ?
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
i &apos;ll just show you the new york times website .
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
antonym : healthy , powerful , powerful .
and the world that we live in now looks like this .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
the only problem with this was that she had 10 children .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
but these are all the roads in the u.s. .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
play is the tickle that keeps us together .
how would you like to be better than you are at the moment ?
everybody knew your genius was a little laugh .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
so , climate change is going to become terrible for you .
but volume is much bigger than ever before .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
so gender can occur in many different ways .
are they mindful and mosquito like 007 ?
and less usable or usable it is .
and even , you know , you know , you know , much less than i did .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
so how do we work when we look in there ?
he described one as a very common one .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve added watermarks .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
we go to the poor of the placebo industry .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
and that &apos;s also there , and that &apos;s coming back .
i &apos;ll never play any more like that moment .
maniok is something that &apos;s half a billion people eat .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
wouldn &apos;t it be more beautiful to open your doorways ?
and these were sort of the first people developed toys .
and there are projects like this at every level of the government .
so the occupation movement has done it .
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
here &apos;s the updated version of this entrance .
we should put the bear in the cage .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and alert .
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
they get a model that comes out of the earth .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and these interactive portraits are perceiving each other .
and it &apos;s also deeply embedded in our lives .
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
we returned to the titanic wreck .
it was an extreme situation . it took an extreme solution .
living itself doesn &apos;t have a voice in that choice .
where &apos;s the biggest interest in doing this ?
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation &apos;s fuels .
it &apos;s a form of recurrent behavior , right ?
at one point , the screen is filled with leaves .
and also , the empowerment of energy is very important for them .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
how can i do something as possible ?
this year it was almost 50 million times .
every society is shaped by a primary medium .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
i love this guy ; his phrase is unaffordable .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and no , it &apos;s not fancy or san francisco .
zidane , at a moment of the head .
because artists have a broken relationship to lie .
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive .
and elé ! thank you very much for all of this .
i &apos;m still going to keep writing because that &apos;s my job .
i &apos;m going to take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
well , today we know everything about where our things come from .
but for many people , this is a little too radical .
with pivot , you can dive in a decade .
well , we introduced the mayor belhole .
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing games !
because we don &apos;t make things free .
it &apos;s steel every five , hope from my consciousness .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
paralysis is a series of too many choices .
this is an interactive animation .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
we had no words for what we started there .
i &apos;d like to continue doing this work that i love .
in the future , most crimes will be online .
and the film is called &quot; the steady button . &quot;
this is great . this is the digital physical thing .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gate .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
it &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no streaming .
we currently spend three billion hours a week with online games .
also urban designers and construction workers are very interested .
30 years ago , that would have sounds ridiculous .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
is it great for others , or is it affecting us ?
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the threshold .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
bg : an energy breakthrough is the most important .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t shake yourself .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
in fact , the notes are very vague and inaccurate .
edward castronova is an economist .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still put together .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; get it wrong .
and then we offer one of these great dunes .
now , in this area , there are not several thousand targets .
the cell communities started to abstract information again .
and everybody knew it worked that way , right ?
that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
as i said , it just started .
he &apos;s now standing on the red list of dangerous ways .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the steck .
how do you judge people because of their characteristics ?
the biggest difference between them is the process over time .
but i really believe that something else comes after us .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
the next step was to find the apps for that .
what other metamorphosis did they go through ?
this constant feedback is not in real life .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like others .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish . &quot;
and the question is , are they good news or bad news ?
we know another one where all the gas stations are .
so the growth rate itself is speeding up .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
you don &apos;t know anything in this gold fish glass . &quot;
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s in there .
in both cases , surgery became , and it was fine .
here it says , &quot; put your finger on every light . &quot;
so you just go to google movie project.com .
a research semester of natural user interface design .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
i sell scholars all over the country , around the world .
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can flip this around .
now , how do people die in a series of hacks ?
no , throwing away is exactly the right thing , right ?
1m is the highest i &apos;ve seen .
that &apos;s not how it works for remembering itself .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to that .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my lap .
a manhattan project ? how do we get there ?
both cases nailed me , ask me .
that &apos;s why thinking about how to weigh .
we were just blowing around the way we were doing it .
many people talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing now .
so when sound says there &apos;s no soul .
i was literally obsessed with studying the deep sea .
by the way , this is the most difficult part in my talk .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not always doing things the same way .
i can &apos;t play the way in 20 years today .
as a child , i always drew comic books and so on .
in the course of this journey , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
when we start to think about it , it changes everything .
this is star night , probably never seen before .
our steps in the digital world were exponentially .
another example is what &apos;s called virtual reality .
we have an abstract language .
anwalt : i &apos;m a lawyer .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
i worked in a coal mining -- dangerous .
and yet , there is this mental copy .
there &apos;s plenty of crowdsourcing .
it had not suffered from treatable brain damage .
it could happen within a time-learning framework .
that means that the crime rate goes back .
and of course , how does design impact on perception .
so how a human being addresses with certain things .
and he shrugged and said , &quot; so ? &quot;
they put them on the beating machine .
ok , imagine how extreme self-motivation is .
it was the misguided cross against drugs .
that &apos;s what happened to be the nanotube machine age .
there is a political argument in our country .
ask questions , demand evidence , demand evidence .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
all that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
and the fish was also lucky to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
there &apos;s even more about it , it &apos;s even deeper .
but we just know a little bit about where things go .
just as it happened to be in the village before .
i know what people think when they see that .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
but actually , that night , it was an even bigger fun one .
but together , you can create something special like this .
this was not a movie , no hd , it was real .
what are they going to consume ? what are they desire ?
it was automatically called the comprehensive stone .
have you ever seen a climax tree ?
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
in fact , the progression is based on energy progress .
because , you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
here &apos;s a short video of what we &apos;re doing .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
it slows down to none of our big problems .
new america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
the idea is to overlift a digital security system .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
he recorded a famous photograph . what did it mean ?
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;ll explain it .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
click , and wum , you &apos;re in this museum .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
i wasn &apos;t there long time ago with miguel .
we see the process that feeds itself .
frosty , the carbon man will clean every day .
diginotar is a certification .
thylacines ? yes . alive ? yap .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
because the pictures made it real for them .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
dipheld , snap , baby paralysis ...
so i &apos;m going to take a step back , and i &apos;m going to get the perspective .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and it was an experience that i couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie .
she was a gun , powerful woman , she had an effect .
they still describe the brochure as untouched .
so let &apos;s quickly try to figure out what the goal is .
so , in a sense , technology is overwhelming us .
so i know some of you who haven &apos;t contributed .
i filmed in warfare -- difficult and dangerous .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
but what if you want to see the paintbrush ?
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done that .
however , it wasn &apos;t the equivalent of the year .
and then we set up a lot of simulations .
and so he &apos;s escaping his agonizing conditions .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
it &apos;s this gorgeous taste .
we can actually do the same things with less energy .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
i always start with a scarf , an idea .
when we build cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
this is a version of one thing that was made .
because the musical instrument is the extension of our body .
it &apos;s like asking someone to beat the sun .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
well , the energy epiphany has fallen over time .
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
my grandfather was in prison during prohibition .
a baby needs about six feet of wind .
it caused immense jug in the control room .
in other words , game is our adaptation joker .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge . &quot;
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here to here .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
this is not an ad , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
the shrimp eats the phytoplankton .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
he only lived for three years .
a few years ago , i started developing littits .
imagine if you could really start flying .
what is this new state that is taking the world slowly ?
one of my friends made it -- richard bollingingingling .
and my talk today is going to be mostly about these cognitive trade-offs .
open the map , and jump with a click .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
and i don &apos;t expect it to ever change .
it &apos;s also my great , life-long love and fascination .
and this is from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound tapestry .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot about transparency right now .
and the predictions that you &apos;ve read are serious .
please follow me because the circle will close .
my uncle died of alcohol infected diseases .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and even today , we &apos;re still very , very strong in stories .
ohhhhhhh , wwww !
and i can tell you , it was a transformative experience .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
i have a friend driving a passerati .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
we also brought littits to design schools .
let &apos;s call the animal beginner , it costs a lot of money .
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds .
why do they acquire us if we can &apos;t buy ?
this is an idiotic debate . it &apos;s got to stop .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to prepare for injustice .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing real garbage .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
well , i play with you sometimes , but not very often .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a multi-cellular community .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it .
this is the period when you fall in love .
and it does this because of content in the images .
if one neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
i mean , how much do we consume from our memories ?
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
this is the chesapeake bay .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
and because we get older , the windmills get bigger .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing going on in the stats &apos; film .
i just want to say a little bit about salatdressing .
but if you can , if you can go to an foreign foreign foreign bribe .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
we have the capital of the techno-philanthropy .
i hope you &apos;re forward to it . thank you very much .
and then i &apos;ll notice immediately , that &apos;s unfair .
i won &apos;t tell you , because i want to use it .
and the film is called &quot; the steady button . &quot;
second , combined photos should have the same type of lighting .
and also , what you would think of in the mind today .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
and we &apos;re going to replace oil with other energy carriers .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heartbreaking wish .
10 minutes later , the judge announced a break .
like algae -- and other terrifying things .
just that i think it &apos;s more like him , right ?
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them well .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
i mentioned this to miguel , and he kidnapped .
these are many deaths from masses , 20 an hour .
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
i mean , let &apos;s ask : why do we fight that ?
but it turns out it &apos;s not all that .
because they &apos;re the people who are also experts in flavor .
and yeah , i have a job , as you may recognize .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death rate .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not able to do it .
for example , that would be somebody who is completely logical .
that all of our lives are connected to each one another .
so the pink the belly the better the system . &quot;
the more money you make the happier you are .
this approach is true for anything we do creative .
and they illuminate the path through the rest of the book .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost forever .
we moved to something called the avian age before .
well , your own life itself will not become happier .
this is the publication that we just finished recently .
somewhere here , there &apos;s a series of photographs -- there they are .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat hits 300 .
since that time , we &apos;ve been given all sorts of recognition .
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding this morning , &quot; he said .
this is about 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
this is a picture of an orange in kentucky .
in 2010 , we just connected to two billion people online .
i studied printer , and she was in breathing .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone in this audience .
and this was the first time i learned this .
a very concrete wish for us to invent this technology .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
i can say the canvin is a man .
i know now it was the reason of the ocean .
he &apos;s got 15 food processing from 15 to one .
and all the time , i gathered more and more .
it was completely exclusive that it could fail .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
and this video was actually finished in january .
you know , there were no mandarins in paradise .
they &apos;re clearly interacting with their environment and their experiences .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird things .
you can do this trick with your friends and neighbors . thank you .
we &apos;ve now deployed in holland for over three years .
so that really reversed me , and i wanted to do more .
yeah , this is what it looks like at the bottom .
the invention of language , for example , was a small step in this direction .
according to its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
there are many others , but i &apos;m missing time .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us care .
that &apos;s not resources efficiency , it &apos;s effective .
today , i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
a few months went over , and i had just forgotten everything .
and immediately , i see a different pattern that comes out .
each one of those topics , of course , was made of many , many smaller decisions .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to become more efficient .
and all of a sudden , he no longer appeared to be human .
and i celebrate , i cry like a little kid .
players are masters in the poet of social nets .
so in the west , people in the west have been thinking about creativity .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
so from the same , bad team of one under the best .
and of course , it can never exist in germany . &quot;
one consequence was that the telephone was never broken .
and the more i talked about , the more i should tell you .
how do we transfer these feelings from the games into reality ?
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit in my tiny suitcase .
and i don &apos;t mean less successfully , although that &apos;s part of it .
an amazing failure rate . one in nine innocent .
or if you want to be fitter , stronger , more force .
my great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about in a minute .
now , where do we go , what is the right approach ?
these are all in the front of them .
they &apos;re in there , they want to go to the end of the gang .
and then people could eat that , and they wouldn &apos;t be blinded .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boy as a client .
we &apos;ve been used to think that things are linear .
this is somebody who , by the way , hits four .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing a rolling iceberg .
i want to present to you two , maybe three examples .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have soul .
welcome the fear of welcome . name the risk .
they can throw them away where they go and stand .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire department .
they did it by taking off the land .
the things that are only being used are technical systems .
it was a store called drama .
then let &apos;s project this analogy into the future .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
so it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet everything has changed .
are they there ? they look a little bit nervous .
so , if you could put the lights back on .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
we just crossed the 7-billion-dollar brand .
so the device you can see there didn &apos;t work .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned assembly language .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineer collectively .
that &apos;s the first year losing half of its value .
i apologize that i have to shrink so much .
we &apos;re talking about the escape of information overflow .
there &apos;s a direct recovery system for that .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and sure , we can find fast-food chain .
one of the things that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting about vision .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
the nature of software usually takes a few years to create .
now , where would you position your brain on that scale ?
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
we need to join the government machine .
i sent her home without talking to my doctor .
i just wish i could see my children growing up .
and what happened is that i needed an expert .
and i promised them to fund an expedition .
because that &apos;s where the actual government work is .
the cost of solar energy last year was about 50 percent .
it &apos;s got eyes of life , one after another .
second , what economists call opperpetual cost .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
there were no christmas trees . we did all this .
i play explaining what these notes might have .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with .
again , what kind of potential do we want to call ?
because all of these new technologies now feed themselves .
if it didn &apos;t move anymore , you buried it .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what &apos;s truly fantastic .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mies .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
i knew she &apos;d come to say she &apos;d come .
he said he doesn &apos;t know that . he &apos;ll ask me questions .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
because your life depended on whether you did the job right .
i say that , because i think identity is very important .
and another example is the ambient , smart systems .
so they move around and they make art installations like this .
that &apos;s why they help , ask people to ask .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also smelling well .
i believe it and i feel like we should teach it .
and it &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
a typical walmart offers 100,000 products today .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
the program i use here is a little experiment .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
would you not want to make these changes in your genes ?
which one would you like to have if she could only have one ?
but also our perception of how it fails us too .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
how many doors have the house they live in ?
when we looked at how emotions are different from income .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what feeds you ? &quot;
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
i went home through the emergency department of emergency room .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
today , we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something , we do with it .
and then we started negotiating insula .
i was shocked and shrushed to the inside .
but so far , i &apos;ll do it a little bit curious .
most of my activities , i have two hatches .
you can see the person wondering what happens inside .
the words , as long as his friends , mount now of his friends .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
what it ruined was the memory of the experience .
and most of all , i think , is , what is the right thing to do .
it was the fear of terror that formed her life .
it turns out that dna synthetic is very difficult .
that keeps us at the distance and allows us to continue to evolve .
there &apos;s a step-by-step recovery .
now , memory itself is a storyteller .
i no longer argued with my wife for two years .
this first one , this was more like a passionate monkey .
we &apos;re going to meet a few days in the next few days .
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
the epiphany is that death is part of life .
i started to think that i should just come up with the project .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
we have lots of cells that are no longer on their own .
so the driving force behind this is cyber-superpower .
do you know how many decisions do you make on a typical day ?
it &apos;s about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
but they don &apos;t notice the loss of loss .
it &apos;s impossible to tell how the photograph was actually assembled .
they add a blue to a green one , and they can make light .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived it .
more and more people just came in because they were angry .
and what we found is that there was actually a relationship .
we think about our future as a foreseeable memories .
because the music is a language , and it &apos;s a language to communicate .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes really fast .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
a fish up , but also a bird reserve .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentations .
yet we still get to the galapagos islands .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take you away .
because in the marine protected areas , we basically make the past .
am i just as if i could write a song ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
so we &apos;ve fathered the time-scale renewables .
sometimes i lose balance . i end with a story .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum of all kinds of ideas .
it turns out if you can get that to zero .
we can , of course , look at the waste problem .
just too precise time points , they agree .
so the question is , how do we deal with these windmills ?
so today , evolution can happen at the time of microseconds .
so , for example , the environment , the less car .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technical definition of the platform .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
most of you are completely ignored by memory .
and online criminals are very easy to understand .
i want to end with a story that really excited me .
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
has one single person in the audience ever seen anyone die of masses ?
if the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
they like to test it after my talk in their rooms .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
she said it was like a donesive train out of air .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
also , in any store , you can get things back .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
and she asked him , what are your pants ?
so if i put them next to each other , that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested in .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
we have cases , like diginotar .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
i was the only one who could talk to the aircraft .
and that &apos;s what happened in the case of diginotar .
they evaporate their urine . they almost never do .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
the most powerful mountain workers is the head of massey coal .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego space .
it &apos;s almost as if we &apos;re prepared to prepare our lives .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it wasn &apos;t just that way .
you make the mistake now , and you pay it a lot later .
we found this in terms of the happiness of living self .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure you go to .
think of this as a visual point , as a flying point .
you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e-book .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
most people usually start to orient themselves on the task .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just from our heads .
when you walk , yeah , every footprint destroys the ground .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think in the next few years .
we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see at the end .
if we overpower it , we can shoot it a little bit back .
there &apos;s a magical crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i have to tell you , i think this was a big mistake .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes modern progress possible .
this is a whole book , an example of non-visual data .
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
i mean , what does someone do with so many outfits ?
i became the miracle part , not to die that day .
he said , &quot; there are no death penalty in germany . &quot;
maximizing freedom to maximize choice .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
then the same thing happens in a good , prohibited conversation .
we record pictures of these mini-big bang in detectors .
because he doesn &apos;t know where to go first to .
economists call this a pareto-enhancement .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think so .
we can move from the poster to a physical perspective of this environment .
car colors , outside color , i have 56 options .
and as a general term , we can use the word of intersexuality .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
they don &apos;t even come out of the museums .
here , he highs a rare glimpse .
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
and i thought it would be so hard , so painful .
tempt is going to be part of the show , which is kind of off .
this is scandalous , and we should be ashamed .
and this is the value of this experience , this is so simple exercise .
how did he get to look for aid in this particular way ?
wr wants to help people who were innocent .
and the best part of this is probably what we &apos;re looking at in the area of health .
we produce androgen , and we talk to androgens .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
we could reduce that by 10 percent , of course , but what does that do ?
the less i kind of think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
they have a fifteen percent renewables today .
but as you &apos;ve been talking to different people in the world about these possibilities .
let &apos;s jump to moma , again , back in new york .
and if you can do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is technology innovation that &apos;s available today .
you feel that &apos;s the real truth behind the outcome .
bonobos are our closest living relatives .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
the first one of these fall is a resurrection to give complexity .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
usually , you &apos;re just wrong , and some people don &apos;t .
this deputy ran beyond the older black .
but i don &apos;t know how powerful people are going to be .
they invest a lot of their time in the construction of growing structures .
you go around the block , and you take it as an epiphany .
i take the breath of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the tempt room .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it &apos;s going to be supported .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the judge looks at him as an adult , but i see a child .
ceos are a little bit about average , but this is where it gets interesting .
here &apos;s one of the evidence , by the way , that men are not pigs .
and by the way , i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
and i hope you &apos;ll design and play with me like this .
and within a few years , lego in every household .
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern .
and i really want to show you my outfits for this week .
here &apos;s me getting a little bit bigger . we &apos;re looking at the center .
so i decided when i was 15 to become a diver .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion image points , i think .
i always found fireflies in a jar .
from my angle , i looked up at the janitors and down .
many of you will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x-former interpretation of a piece is comparable to that .
a long time ago , there was gray whales -- 500 years ago .
that means that the player &apos;s safe three out of 10 strokes .
six : social failure . seven : 65 dead .
new investment to create well-paid jobs .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
if you look at the people that they have to do with .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
and they did this with something called lead-maps .
imagine every single person being controlled .
what about the contributions that we can &apos;t even predict ?
okay , let me squeeze a little bit of blood for you .
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
and that &apos;s also what i &apos;ve had in the last half-year .
but somehow we can get away from this problem .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
turn the landfill on the page . went home .
it was always so inspiring , so refugee .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
i ate him first in a restaurant in southern spain .
this is my brand in my small , distorted industry .
and these are just the biohackers , the individual people .
this is an excerpt from this angular code .
so i worked on this when it &apos;s natural or intuitive .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity .
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
so maybe you should have a little bit of this before the interview . &quot;
we degrade one person who has value for our society .
it means that we have a cultural impact besides the scientific impact .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
well , in fact , the number of violent crimes didn &apos;t change very much .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t come to court .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
we slaughtered his bed so that he can look outside .
alone , this airport has a hundred square kilometer .
we use games to escape the suffering of the real world .
and six milliseconds , even a very exciting phenomenon .
so it turns out to be very difficult to get out of all these extensions .
that goes far further back into the cultures of the pre-industrial age .
our gut is a wonderful hostile environment for these bacteria .
from that time , an anecdote you may know .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t leave myself down .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-restorative .
the biggest fear was that they had pirate , rape and death .
somebody had broken up , and they had hacked the system .
so , this looks like a basketball billboard billboard .
but a lot of people get caught up in a very peculiar position .
but apart from that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
it &apos;s actually only taken about two thousand really , these networks .
no longer need to whistle or sing a love .
so , i think it &apos;s a very yellow hack .
i brought with seven underpants , and that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange land road .
well , i wondered , how can i get this done ?
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
i asked him how he became such a fish expert .
i think it &apos;s kind of a sixty-dollar or something like that .
there were the core research facility of leopods .
now , living itself is constantly alive .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
there &apos;s an enormous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
now , the two types of self drop two terms of happiness .
photographs like this : a construction site on a much rigid road .
i grew up with a polite portion of science fiction .
an eighth , negotiated brand . how is your brand ?
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building existential , not intensive .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the minerals .
and i &apos;m not sure they &apos;re really devastating .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
they increase the paralysis and they reduce happiness .
well , that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is , if i can take a little trip .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
the component is getting more and more and more to the friend that you live with .
so , finally , there was a company trying to make it right .
how can a judge turn someone into something he &apos;s not ?
so there are programs that are most likely to use .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynch mobs .
so a couple of years ago , i started doing this .
it &apos;s as clear that the answer to the question is : it is .
a few . probably about as many as creative people here .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of constraints .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate now ? &quot;
why is it important to start fresh ? what is the red ?
after all , we should be welcome fear .
there was , in my opinion , a very good code .
in fact , that &apos;s the real melting of man and machine .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s lots of it out there .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
what about a sentence of new , never heard of hearing voices before .
possibilities that wouldn &apos;t have been allowed were incredibly encouraged .
for example , the fish had been recorded on a trip .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
basically , the concrete had become the building block of our time .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s 2,500 years back .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
ah , the majority . i like to think of this as a doctor .
it &apos;s renewables , as they &apos;re often called .
and the best part is they connect with magnets .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent it home .
the notes have written in the process of writing the letters .
and that urgency , that goal , really changed my life .
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on the planet .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
the modern industrial world as we know it is almost 300 years old .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death penalty .
and i ask , how skillfully competent was this diagnosis ?
and if they &apos;re at risk , then really bad things can happen .
i looked in the rake , and it was a little pink .
this is a fish up in the southwestern corner of spain .
and then we &apos;ve been able to do a coding real-life recovery .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , in this particular pitch .
some of my lens happened over the last five years .
then these are interconnected impacts of the pre-industrial cultures .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
so the dramatic high rates are coming to prison .
what does that relate to the thought and feelings about yourself ?
now , what &apos;s the placebo effect of placebo effect ?
but nothing was invented that would let me go back so far .
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
this is my wlan . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
should i answer that email ? should i write that letter ? &quot;
54 percent of the deaths fell through drill .
that means you navigated with sound and rhythm .
it &apos;s actually only about a two-week period .
when someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
so all of these green areas , these are the most targeted environments .
we develop into collaborative thinking , heart creatures .
even if you shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
and this is called androgen receptor .
do you know what it &apos;s called a 3000-year-old in major league baseball ?
so i offered a $ 10,000 prize for the winner .
and the key indicator for this is the extinction of languages .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
most people know this from the software sector .
these people will be connected to the film forever -- forever .
and i had to explain to the journalist that there &apos;s no test .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about genetic engineering food .
and so i think the ted community should be more taper .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
and that &apos;s the message that i took in medical school .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you ted .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunavine .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to look at as a ph.d. student .
this is actually live on the internet now . you can check it out .
i think in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
well , finally , the film has a very big snapshot .
and it &apos;s spread incarceration , organic , of course .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
there was no piano at the moment when there was no piano .
we find other odds about what their rights are .
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a smarter one .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a completely different world .
this piece of 50 year-old technology became the most magical thing for me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
it &apos;s about creating goods overflow .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it .
this is our youngest betaver right there .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never met each other as adults .
and somehow , we have to make changes that go to zero .
this is the period of most perceptions that we have .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
and when i listened to her , she made chuky sounds .
at the end of march , the lhc will be working again .
and so , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
if you could do it for you , you could also help me .
and just so all of these companies disappeared , one after another .
if we actually don &apos;t pick up phosphorus and abandon .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big deal .
and i was good , i graduated from cum lens .
people here contributed to developing many of these miracles .
we &apos;ve distributed littits to children and see them play with it .
but there are over 48 hours of video being uploaded to youtube per minute .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combination lead to success .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i looked at her and smiling , but she looked very seriously .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violin concert .
loud and light signs , f and b , etc .
the human is to get off the monkeys or have a common ancestor .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other one is called swing . &quot;
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gray and stuff .
what were its circumstances , like society and politics ?
on september 10 , last year , the machine ran for the first time .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human being .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely intractable .
i love this : &quot; watson forces human enemy . &quot;
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology to connect with it ?
three months later , i was moved around , and the adventure continued .
i don &apos;t know what they think of me , but i can live with that .
and this is something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
here it says the more you kill , the better .
people said , are you not afraid to succeed ?
this is all reality today , and the future will be much more possible .
so it allows us to play together the growing of commitments , trust and with each other .
in my view , mass incarceration has fundamentally changed our world .
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good percentage of intuition to actually do experiments .
i went to the car and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
in the short run here , i realized that ted has an identity .
so unfortunately , we have god a little bit removed to virtual .
even if it &apos;s hardly attached to play , it &apos;s probably most necessary .
now there &apos;s all this mess before the big unveiling .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , to be bad at all .
bruno guissani : mark , come back .
eight : tsunami warning . speaker 9 : cyberattacks
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
&quot; do you remember the patients you sensing home ? &quot;
just swap out the building of apartments against cities .
because lying is that you can just apply that logic .
we live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water .
often , music class is that you learn to read the notes .
because that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
and i tend to see widrilling as my shadow .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear power plants .
it &apos;s naturally from asia , in the case of japan .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it . they didn &apos;t buy it .
the official beliefs of all western industrialized societies .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
and you can see that there are enormous speeds there .
so i sat down , and you played the tedtalk .
we should be able to eradicate everything we want .
you can only have zero-sum missions if you &apos;re not there .
so studies have been conducted to see if that was true .
but it does something that no other government technology does .
this was the first beginning of a musical expression .
they say that you never forget the names of the people who die .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
but when i ask you , how do you do with your wife ?
it &apos;s fine . the question is , how are we going to do it ?
you collect information about the play in the sixth literature .
what they need is an environment that they use .
but what if the image connects you to all your images ?
and as i say the word justice , this unpleasant feeling is gone .
under a hat , i &apos;m looking at the story of anatomy .
before i close the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
my grandmother sat at the end of the room , staring at me .
big data is transformed to organizations around the world into big opportunities .
at the same time , it &apos;s a real-time 3d scan and a movement recording .

they &apos;re helping regret nutrition , and they &apos;re protecting them against certain diseases .
but to be part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
and this was an example of how our own governments use technology against us , citizens .

for us and it &apos;s play fundamental to attachment to relationships and care .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i apologize .
this is the first object you can see , which was in quantum mechanical superposition .
now you might think that the whole collapse of categories would make somebody really happy to me .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
these are our master-player . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
but i was worried about these articles , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i figured it out .
what would they do that they shoot , because they think they were there forever ?
one is the energy dentists that make these technologies dramatically lower than power plants .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been more true than it is today that it &apos;s less .
a tv or a washing machine that you just use , you don &apos;t use it .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this rotated stuff , like maniok .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to think the fish knows something .
we just wanted to know what about normal electrical chemical battery .
in a sense , the arctic ice capsule is the beating heart of our global climate system .
for bonobos and humans , equally , life is not made out of teeth and claws alone .
i thought , &quot; well , put the camera out &quot; would mean that we wanted to have a background conversation .
if you put an executive administrator on the team , they become significantly better .
bill gross has several companies , including one called esolar , who has great solar panels .
so , for example , the number 164 sticks out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order to which this information is presented .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
that means 15 pounds of wild fish are required to get a pound of water tuna .
our cities , in the last few years , have been equipped with networks and electronics .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just the fact that architecture almost disappears .
when those images fall down , they can write on it , they can display patterns , text .
i &apos;m convinced you &apos;re kind of drawn to nostalgia , to wonder .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and soul itself that we can afford .
and what we can almost read in the dayday newspaper , which is in that third sentence .
you might think this is just a landscape , and the lower part was manipulated .
and sometimes , when something comes to ted , it gets a sense and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
or are we going to be something else -- something that may even be adapted to the environment ?
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we all fight about who &apos;s allowed to speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
an example of this from a completely different area . monet painted the six times .
because obviously an animal that has been very common before it dies .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique pitch of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
i really hope that we play together significant games to survive on this planet another century .
the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
and i want to encourage you to protocol that i &apos;ve been here for my part of the job today .
and the preparation was enormous . we had to build cameras and shrimp and everything .
you have to make the sound of the winds , blow it away and read the rest of the book .
this was our first attempt to start with digital information , the genomes phi x 174 .
and the next piece of puzzle is about four women in three generations building together a new life .
we &apos;ve come to a point where we don &apos;t have the same ratio to progress as we used to .
just to give you the overview , i zoom out , so you can see what you get .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
and as part of that , they created an idea that was about anatomical commonalities .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of evolution are slowly mating , but they are incomprehensible .
players love to become part of an awe of planetary missions .
it occurred to me that our cars would take us and dare cameras out of it .
in china , a recovering honey today is still hull notes , so on , like , right ?
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there were probably no bullet in their treatment .
you know , there are two countries that control almost seven percent of the phosphorus reserves in the world .
i was the second volunteer at the brand , so i had pretty good opportunities to be able to go in .
it actually took us a few years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of how this slide is supposed to show .
how can we keep them fresh , more fresh , more fresh , three times more fresh .
but what makes voodoo so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are the master player .
and the byists make androgens that are virious hormones .

you can &apos;t just emphasize enough how critical this factor can be to the quality of a human being .
the next puzzle is how a boat is running out in the early homicide red lens .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , so long as you &apos;re not a particle physicist .
either &quot; flute fusion &quot; or a &quot; paradise winds , &quot; you &apos;ll have a choice .
as a child , i had collections of sticks , rocks and claws .
and in reality , when we fail , when we hit obstacles , we often feel different .
and for her life , her life , she had a job : the flooding of her family and a new life in australia .
to these archaic models , we have a natural relationship to virtually natural relationship to virtuality .
on the other day , they let them go -- woman printer , a mother and grandmother .
and so you can see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade , that they can survive there .
michael j. nelson from the mystery science theater was a first one to make a joke about twitter .
so , in the kind of shifting the burden of evidence , you experience the magnitude of lie .
already in some flat lakes in alaska methane from the water itself .
both of them are strong underlying because we don &apos;t look at the problem the way we should .
so to understand each other , i want to show you an elementary , very simple magic trick .
and also , despite her logarithmic process on the left-hand side , she &apos;s going up .
so , i guess , or evil aquakulture , fishing , will be part of our future .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most common children &apos;s book author .
but not true , we have seven percent in europe , and our net is physically seen the european .
it sounds very space-time , and it sounds like science-fiction , i know .

it sort of managed to find the time to get english and it-qualifications .
now , all the rest that the numbers that the numbers have best sorted .
his mother was locked in as a punishment for crimes -- to be wealthy .
that i &apos;m just doing this differently and more beautiful doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
we need to prevent people from knowledge from things , especially when they are true .
in this country , there are children living longer for children without conditions .
this is what it takes us to understand under police correctness , to bring it back .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
so let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can anticipate development .
this is almost limited to complete security -- potentially for the fish , definitely for us .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- it &apos;s taken me out of the socks .
and that &apos;s half of all the water problems in the world that are caused by the textile industry .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privileged , before ease , against inconsistency .
the idea here , obviously , is not just to overlimit the machine operators in the control room .
so we could very easily eradicate the world with stupid , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now , when i was a noble in college , i had my first biology class .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
we say , &quot; computers , please generate a hundred million randomly chosen sequences of instructions . &quot;
we know from this study that you have to reach the needle when it comes to the needle .
we know that as human beings , when we do hard , meaningful work .
maybe to go back to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creativity .
we now have almost an infinite selection of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe of nootka-indian tribe .
make the techniques that are easy to use and start with this to hug patients in the team .
so maybe we sell a shoe , and it will become the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever wore .
why not have the fast muscle fiber optics that will allow you to run faster and longer ?
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to learn from myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let it go .
and so from the interest of this , this technology , i just went on to this technology .
in high school , a fellow student said that brian goldman would learn for a bloop .
so if we look at the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
so basically , when you look at something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible .
this is a whole bunch of things that you &apos;re looking at next to the actual existence .
and this question was so tangible that we decided to explore the answer and developed sideways .
if someone asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , how about it ?
all of this needs the ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
and like a lot of people , i thought it was mainly about picking people into an amt .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by kicking the pace in one way or another .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard about before .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that &apos;s suffering us is our imagination .
this is called the law , or just stology , which also affects us in perception .
and maybe we don &apos;t know what wood we &apos;re cut when we &apos;re actually tested .
a third sentence that immediately appears to people who have a strong sense of soul .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since it &apos;s been , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
for example , we &apos;ve developed an ice packaging package , which is at room temperature .
most of the mass incarceration in this country was not really in the class of violent crimes .
so to me , photography seemed to be more likely to be at the right place at the right time .
and that sadness really formed in one thought , which is that i just wish one thing .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever written by hand .
so a lot of people also come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the emergence of species and the ancestry of man .
do you say that there are negative impacts that have to do with the clouds that are changing ?
well , you can see , in all cases , no one has to be an extraordinary candidate .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some downsides .
you don &apos;t sit around and turn around . there &apos;s always something important to do .
unfortunately , they &apos;re not in the open stream , but maybe they can help the france a little bit .
this is sort of the deadline that showed us the environmental models that we have to stop .
this reference will suggest that money will be invested in more security and security .
police officers came in and dedicated government officials and officers .
our memory tells stories , which means what we need to keep from our experience is a story .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish was shrinking on half its size .
i was assumed that they don &apos;t bite . they &apos;re actually not going to leave the glass .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your neighbor &apos;s cells ?
and that &apos;s because these fanatics who were not doing any fanatics at all .
that &apos;s great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
nothing goes out in my sleeve or comes out , no trickiness , and you can study everything .
this is also the entertainment of this speech , so i hope , d hated you .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us feel .
and also , recently , a study done with ceos , where they saw the ceos for a week .
you can see it &apos;s a kind of pillar , often known as the &quot; walking wave . &quot;
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what happened to the $ 7100 ?
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed that dot for a long time to select our public good .
it &apos;s important for the stages , which are usually in the first semester , the great law .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half their drinking water out of this melting water .
we developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
i remembered that last year when i brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked it .
but actually , my research at the institute of the future is the opposite .
it &apos;s almost physiologically impossible to be bad if you &apos;re wearing red pants .
the viral particles were then released by the cells and came back and killed e. coli .
do we use these decisions to shape society that &apos;s better , which is more friendly , which is more friendly ?
and this really reaches these ideas to create these limitations for the available place on the screen .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing the lifestyle .
so we had to develop a new method where we could put these little pieces together and correct the errors .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , living about six million years ago .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and make this crazy case .
so we have the memorial self and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
i admired my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
if i went to a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got to face two years later when we moved to california .
and i said , &quot; excuse , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember it . &quot;
unfortunately , that &apos;s the good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned a lot .
and it &apos;s humiliating to think that maybe our species have existed for 600,000 years .
i got another gift , which is to see the future , and come back and live differently .
so for the learning process , you need to have at least as long as spoken language .
we managed to get it to about a hundred genes from the 500 or so on .
so we overlift our brains , because our brains simply don &apos;t really accept it .
because a lot of people come , you can &apos;t use it friendly , so that anyone can deal with it .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my physiotherapy .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
people are shredding in their faith , so tightly that you can &apos;t free them .
here we see this again , again , this is the one , again , again , the whole , single aggregate .
and we &apos;re going to install an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the microsecond area .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
so in other words , the future is shrinking every year since i &apos;m in the world .
if you surround yourself with the right people , you won &apos;t just understand it , you will appreciate it .
evolution is all about the genome of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation after generation .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor that seems a little bit difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
so doing these kinds of things -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
all right , just to close , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
when we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
i mean , it sounds very banal for the first time , but it &apos;s exciting when you get to it .
overview : now i interact with the object , i can zoom out , zoom in .
they shoot the decision -- push it up , even when it comes to your own best interest .
this is a game of words that is a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle .
if you break the gold fish glass , so everything is possible , you reduce happiness .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and increase my strength and regret .
the greeks called these divine potent poisoning of creativity .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re just different from a few nucleotides ?
in the rich world , there are diseases that millions of us have only threatened before one generation , hardly .
who knows when the film comes out , we might look like a horse vollidiot .
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you say , &quot; let &apos;s go out of oil . &quot;
here we see a very basic service . is there light at home so you can read the homework ?
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how it &apos;s taken over to the next century .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon children will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
because if we could figure that out , we would never have known human potential before .
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer this immediately , but this is what &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
i &apos;m sure i would never reach an alien world with a spaceship , and it seemed pretty unlikely to me .
by the way , there &apos;s a corner where i &apos;m not going to tell you about the spinal cord .
the founding fathers were the original anatomic activists , and that &apos;s why .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are the success of the scientific method .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 rocks for every person on the planet .
they played a cube game , and the winners were allowed to break up to an epic adventure .
it would have been without the environmental requirement , but it makes it much more important .
and to win , the machine has to make better diagnosis than a team of highly skilled doctors .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning of the launch .
the man &apos;s grandfather wasn &apos;t afraid of the arctic night or the waving storm .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he &apos;s got no pencils , he &apos;s got no tape recorder .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of both types of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things at the end .
we hope that it doesn &apos;t mean pop-ups and other nonsense -- it shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
like peter , they not only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
the human part of this book , far from the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
immediately , they become one where there is , of course , for which there is such a prediction , you can &apos;t prove that .
we use this great euphemism , try and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
my heart raved , i was dizzy as i was trying to figure out what was before me .
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you , we could make a , or we could make b .
but back and forth , very rarely , something special happened . one of the actors actually became overwhelming .
for example , in openness , for instance , 20 percent of the garbage is between wind .
but here it is : if you get the evidence , you have to adopt this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
so i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite pictures , harvesting from pieter board in the met .
i want to talk to you about this mechanism today or something that &apos;s unaware of .
the first example is , what many of you know and some of you appreciate and some of you appreciate , very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
and so just these words that we use in the language of politically correct speech .
so these tends to survive longer , and they multiply in size .
but these concepts of cyberage , which brings us these tools back to rediscover our ability to rediscover .
and the main lesson that we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
his cause of writing the piece is becoming increasingly and more and more to my personal cause , to play it .
but there &apos;s no promise that we can look around where you learn how to make fire .
at the moment , it was like a film director would have demanded a stage change .
this is the way i would say , your kid , hit it only three times instead of five times .
it turns out that it really meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to have anything to do with your film . &quot;
recently , i spoke to the oil industry , and they said that they had this model right now .
when professors get curious , they &apos;re often thrown in this kind of research semester .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first fuel in the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
echinese acea , a small antioxidantium that &apos;s helping you to jump .
and what happened is the machine age , and what happened is the book , and it happened is the photolitography .
and it &apos;s about solving a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
no , the lies i &apos;m talking about , which is that they &apos;re fooling themselves .
so , we were able to connect the little digital explosives with the rotor control .
so the nerve cells are the information processing system that these cell communities have built .
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
one way that &apos;s particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used a lot of time is evolution itself .
so , imagine if you were at the same time in many places , what would that feel like ?
we had a team of fellows last year in boston to the code for america .
so , in large and large , we &apos;re very confident that we &apos;ve actually determined what the goal is .
so the idea is that we actually engage the people in which they do things together , collectively .
there are so controversial things like this whole genetically modified plants on the apples .
they lie , they scream , they &apos;re confused and they &apos;re actually producing possible shapes .
you can go and create your own museum -- out of all of these pictures , you can put your own collection .
because the soil is going to die down , and the wind and the water is going to wash away the ground .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve dropped it somewhere .
so , as citizens are able to be able to deal with these scientific technologies .
it &apos;s about how happy or pleasure the person is when that person is thinking about their lives .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of the development department of a nonprofit called robin laden .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to achieve a realistic outcome .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
and if you take a picture of a camera , the process ends when you hit the outside .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can take a long future away .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 parts , as you know it from documentaries .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself and adapt at the same time .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really have to go back to circles .
if anyone built an eight-inch construction , he would have wore the price home .
and every time it &apos;s divided , the finite amount of chemicals have spread out there .
so i wanted to create something else where the process begins when the eradication is pressed .
the result is that , no matter where i come from , i &apos;m being treated like i &apos;m going to be treated .
but not only that -- it merges and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
they &apos;ve reformed earth &apos;s demographics in a way that no war has ever done .
yet , my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , at the age of 15 .
for these non-engineers , littits became another material , electronics just became another material .
i met mr ayers in 2008 , two years ago , when walt disney is steady .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community bring us ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that indian is , but it &apos;s also very time-time .
the rotor is this moving part inside the centrifuge , this black object you see .
and it seemed to have something to do with these gray boxes , these real-time control systems .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you become involved in your mind . how can you be harmed ?
and you &apos;re going to offer all the nutrients that you could only want without any effort on the one hand .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six who have stable structures .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
so people who think of evolution as a gene changed at a time , have missed a lot of biology .
they live in a world that has information and communication in abundance , as no one could have predicted .
i &apos;ve tried to make sense of how valuable cities are , how much value they are than they cost .
this is really important because this is an insight that &apos;s not in a single wiki book .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these things are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
they found an article with false thought , they could feel the creator of this thought .
in holland , of course , you understand it easier , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
if we can do that , then this bish of data , maybe a new source of sensory information .
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yeah , oma . i promise . &quot;
if a mind about those qualities , we can create a new reality and new existence .
maybe that &apos;s the point of widrilling , a sense of the iconic , a sense of our own power .
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language , or basic posture , to build the right prototype .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve discovered with what &apos;s called the gigapi technology .
i know that we can , and as far as i know , this is something that the world needs now .
we want to talk today about how video becomes viral , and then finally , which is why it matters .
the more possibilities that were available to them , the more they put all of their money into res market .
never make a mistake , but nobody cares about the details of how it should be done .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you see right now .
and , although it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard to work , because people are pushing very fast .
but danny , in the entire american desire , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
there are very , very few things that you can even say there &apos;s an opportunity in a million .
iceberg is born as a lion of a glacier , or by breaking out of ice shelves .
our language comes back to the social changes that have been dissolved in many cases by a technological change .
i regret , but i &apos;m trying to learn best from it to pass it to others .
that was the reason . it was the cause . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we made small pieces , we made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
so in this project , we actually designed some little markers to pursue the trash as it goes through the system .
and i noticed how much these deep-sea diving , a space mission .
so the performance of working with prototypes is central -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
here and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population have lost their voting right now .
and when i come , with my little w piesel , and i &apos;ll just point , that feeling comes up .
and every time i interviewed someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
in fact , the recipe for us is our genes , which is exactly the same code and the same writing .
and so they wrote all of these observations , and they called the quantum mechanics theory .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccination for the new yorker , a small article .
now , since the sundance film festival premiere , we can look at this .
and so it &apos;s also rooted in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
so if you want to have better , you have to cross up here and hold your percentage of the deal .
and the first thing i ask is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
in the present time , for example , we have a very modern example , which is filling the daytime .
it lives in the deep sea , about a half miles deep , almost coch-and-a-half-mile temperature .
i have to talk to the man on the street who are like me , otto normal consumers .

imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the burden burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers .
we want to encourage the world of the inventors , the inventors , the inventors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
and we have that , you know , that &apos;s not combine , but that &apos;s not , i think , i think , i think , really well , i think , really well , the people are pretty good at it .
so i stood back with a little team of unknown terrain , and we drew &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , nudelparties and passed through , tony drew drew for the first time .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and we &apos;re expecting first data in june or july , and we &apos;re going to continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
how to raise happiness is very different from how you think and whether you think about the memory of yourself , or whether you think of the living self .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear you speak like this . &quot;
but the latest dna evidence shows that the etruskers who later formed the roman empire , the same dna as the old lydics .
well , there are missing brands and eighth brands , these things that come and go , but a missed , eighteen brand is a pretty strong thing .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a column -- that you dig them up without all the complex .
in a country that has just been elected a significant crisis , in which congress was elected to this change in 124 to a voice .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive grocery grocery store , at least he was really exclusive .
but the logic of deception allows us to do as if the first sentence of prior is wrong , of course , as if you have to take the opposite without evidence .
it &apos;s always a very fortunate concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been working for so long in advance .
but these apps are like small digital memories , that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of the government paying taxes and receiving services .
it seems like we &apos;re right away from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually most importantly , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite the same .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake only happened in the first five years , which many of my colleagues say , but total nonsense .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful stupid to do that , and that we came back and all the pictures on the walls would be free .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , building coal-fired power plants , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or gavaccine , because it &apos;s not possible .
according to burrene , the premier in january , and since -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this film .
but this keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that keeps me awake at night . we &apos;ve never used scientific advance at night .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing and building new life .
so what these reactors were a problem is , what we fill in our fills , and it dramatically reduces the waste volume during this process .
well , in egypt , the insurgent in april of 2011 , the main source of the egyptian intelligence police , and they found a lot of actors .
no , it just looks a lot better if we show that we &apos;re at the same time to eliminate the dangers that the other people are just making when they &apos;re on fire .
so we take something very complicated , we turn it into sound , a sequence of notes , and we produce something very complicated in the head of others .
and it turns out that if you make it feel concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people more .
so , not only are we responsible for preserving the people we love to keep in favor of favor , but also prepare them to prepare good at it .
what about suppressing the oppressed wherever they are to give a voice to make attention and to make change , for the very first time ?
i told my wife , whenever a human in a moral judgment used the word because , we should try to replace it with the words even though .
i love to find another colorful , insane , crazy outfit , and also photographing and blogging lately .
and ultimately , saturday : developing a unique , unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world about one , without having to say a word .
and every year , we ask the students to create products and services , which within a decade , can incorporate the lives of billions of people .
they didn &apos;t count because he was in love with memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had gotten .
i think that the molecular biology generally is talking about , the general , biotechnology , all you count about , synthetic biology and so on .
i came to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral skull of the universe is wiping out far , but it &apos;s increasing justice .
a process that -- as anyone who knows who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everyone here -- not always stopping .
and something interesting happened to me , because what fascinated me about jacques coustean shows was the idea of an entirely unknown world here on earth itself .
and our european verbal network is basically just from loud rotating masses of large power plants , wherever the wave is all over europe .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
so these are just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
this is ayahuasca that many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparat from the repertoire .
even from the german to the english , you can find out more knowledge , once you get distorted or even when it comes to poetry .
i can tell you today the sound that the stream has had , on the modern wing , which is a baroque can &apos;t do .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out that , by using play all this time , we actually change what we &apos;re capable of as people .
and i negotiated with myself that if i doubled my efforts to perfection and never again gave a mistake that the voice could confuse .
the reason is that it used to be better than anything worse when everything was worse , it was bad for people to make experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
we got to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email saying that nathaniel was interested in me .
we all had to do that at the time . if we read a book as children , we took the description of the author and project them on the canvas in our heads .
and if you &apos;ve already heard that the student of stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the user data is a science for itself .
and very often , i worked with intersexual people whose gender is atypical -- so people who don &apos;t show the average male or female body types .
as it would feel to live in a world where the german state made people , especially if there were disproportionately many jews .
are they reliable , stable , family , safer , safely , sacred , sacred , consistent and how the dalai lama or yoda ?
i said , &quot; listen , you know , you know , you and i both know , if this book &apos;s not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ? &quot;
and i &apos;ve argued that we may be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there might be massive new species of education based on this digital design .
and this is where we get tired of the media campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.r. lab , we can actually do this all the time .
and because the government ultimately exhausts its strength from us -- remember , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , will affect how this change happens .
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever committed -- 27 miles in diameter .
because it makes as much sense as anything i &apos;ve heard about when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy thing of the creative process .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spread out by selected , is a kind of shit to the head of the government .
what that means is that if you met someone and you would tell them , oh , your father &apos;s a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous confidence in our future is the fact that today we have more power than individuals to provide us with the big challenges of our planet .
at this point , and if you laugh , you can see how important this gap is , and how much time you need to experience something that artists can share very well with us .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see are flooded canals and these density , lush march .
let &apos;s move back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little bit less comfortable that i talked to you about it .
we have now , from our discoveries all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
but then another one , very interesting step , where things got completely different , which is that these cells started to communicate and exchange information , so that communities were born .
one of the areas in which we see this for beijing , in our culture today , in the united states , the fighters are about the beginning and the end of life .
basically , you get every round on any sidewalk randomly assigned letters , and as you try to form words , they &apos;re checked over a dictionary .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that lets us explore and interact , and the unexpected link that we form is the real nutrition of creativity .
well , i phones with a couple of people in the company , and no one could give me a decent answer , until i finally telephone .
over the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled to inflation in inflation of the world &apos;s population .
if i tell you that somebody put his life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
my wife , my children and i moved to the garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and archists took over our house .
unlike the one-page conversation of the 20th century , the participation of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or making something new out of it .
we can go one step further and rearrange the data and see that circuitry disease and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tuna , the tuna , the saltfish , the salmon , the salmon , the salmon , they &apos;re collapsing .
i got a ticket of ticket , because i didn &apos;t go on the bike , but there are many disabilities that don &apos;t let you drive you on your bike .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility , so that i was acting and so i would be able to take care of my patients without having to contact him .
and when we succeeded , of course , for obesity , for henry and mauritz and all the textile industry .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; in a way .
jacques cousteau came to our living rooms with his amazing shows that showed us animals and places and places and a world of miracles that we could never have imagined before .
in each step , we produced these pieces in the overshock so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , which you &apos;ll see in one minute .
and so i think of myself as one of the people , along with most other experimental quantum physicists , who need good share logic to put the complex ideas together .
and since there was no video games or this oversemination with computer-generated movies or the whole visual language in the media landscape , i had to create the pictures in my head .
bg : well , the actual spending on research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion more than they do today -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
and imagine i even negotiated as a five-year-old child with dr. p. and so i tried to stop these practices , natural without success .
bg : now we need one of these scalable , electricity generating things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then use 20 years to come .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play together some kind of game , to control their health .
as you know , in the village , who has what happened to whom and when , today , this expansion of our self through these mobile devices at a global level .
now , what i hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormonoculture , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
a lot of journalists called me on the question , &quot; what are you going to do to tell us about whether caster semenya is female or male ? &quot;
and it &apos;s not only intuitive usability for apple to be an elementary factor , elementary success factor , if i just wanted to use technology to people .
that means that the interpretations of notation needs to translate those unprecedented language into another , which is audible , concrete , nonverbal music language .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can , in a way , the electric proportions of the island of scale one to three very precisely .
i sold this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship . &quot; it became a lovely film , a passionate film .
the other note is whether we use zero-emission technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest .
so far , it &apos;s always tried to do these insufellowns , which are autark , they have their own little net , which has nothing to do with our interconnectedness and nothing to do with us .
so they invented , according to herodotus , the cube game and complained a national strategy . one day , you would eat . next day you would play .
i &apos;m a mouth . to work , i have to stand up every day at the same time and sweat and sweat and sweat me and sweat through and really awkward .
you have to imagine that if you do something of the classic softing , you have to have five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , you just need an hour .
if you play , you can see some of the nuances here that are zoomed up , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and it &apos;s as if the opposite of the first sentence was already proven and predicted .
and yet , coal mining is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is the remarkable clean coal technology that you see here , it changes everything .
that is , instead of remembering ourselves , we have standardized , widespread patterns of memories that we can hang our personal memories .
and of course , the opportunity at random instructions are very small , that by accident , by accident , you know , they &apos;re not going to do this .
and if you want to go beyond 20 , 30 percent renewable energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn that el .
they should discuss this innovation strategy , and they would be smiled by the ridiculous ones that are being spent in these innovative ways .
and then we screamed out a d.v.d , and then we pulled out the laser , and then we tried to focus on this camera .
a few weeks later , the firefighters received a letter from the house where they were concerned for the tape of their house .
the food that was delivered by a chef or a chef , has to be eaten and not just looked at or traded recipes .
i recently did a survey with over 2,000 american people recently , and the average number of decisions that were attacked by a typical american day is 70 .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat ocean , is as rich as fascinating life as we can hardly imagine .
then the scope of semantic interconnectedness and the abundance that comes out of it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
if people were to take this money seriously , i mean , it all seems to be put on the head , everything we believe , for example , in terms of tax policy and so on .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the creator and funny design -- where we actually founded the company -- too slow .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and therefore , on my palette of music noises , much more color matter , emotions and emotions and emotions than today .
they &apos;re also concerned in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yeah , also electronics bugs , and they &apos;re combining that in a fairly remote way .
well , that &apos;s good , besides paul walking around talking about vaccines and saying how valuable they are , and people should just stop jamming .
it looks a little bit like who doesn &apos;t have any freedom either , can &apos;t be drawn for his actions and claims to be responsible , and therefore he &apos;s unsustainable .
so when i first started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use stored co2 , which could be used to produce production stores , convert co2 to fuel this process .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you &apos;re actually able to blow the rotor and eventually even to explode the centrifuge .
we should call it what it is , an ad in debris , a commercial that quickly rises to ecological capital that will enable this production .
it &apos;s the living self that the doctor prizes -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; is it going to hurt if i look at you here ? &quot;
now , as we go on and sorrow by age , we say , 40 years , or younger , we see that accidents are even the main cause of people to care about .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady cloth of the engine , the clapping of a wave on the bug , the length and empty horizon .
and these scientists just documented the various topics that these ceo employed , and how much time they spent making decisions related to the topics .
everybody thinks i &apos;ve gone away from &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have celebrated the nail on a towel on the beach somewhere .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and you should do that too , because this love story , as romantic as it is , is also inferential .
it was exposed to the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as alien material , and so we only had one cell with a new chromosome .
and by the way , we migrate and circulate and we mix so much that you can no longer say that isolation is necessary for evolution to find state-of-the-art .
well , i hope you agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
so if you take the system the way i was taught it , and you get rid of all the mis-regarded health professionals , no one left .
the second case is a transformation of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between being happy in his life and being happy about his life .
so gender is really complicated ; intersexual activity is not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a certain sense , they can be distributed across the bandwidth .
you go up to this capsule , you float into this dark , hostile environment , where there &apos;s no hope for rescue if you don &apos;t get it back to you .
i think that the remarkable of the events of the past few years is that we &apos;ve been transformed from a physical world to a digital world .
so from that , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from that deforestation to yes , to the idea of a hundred percent renewable .
and from my point of view , the scientific method is to try and see if it works , it changes , if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion when there was a break , octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
and because they work much harder physically than we do , and because they live only three to six months , they come up with their weight , in their energy consumption , a little tricky billion people .
if this device sequences a rnap or dna virus that &apos;s not known , it calls the healthcare authorities and prevents a pandemic in front of its outbreak .
a lot of arguments about this . fishing contaminants contaminate the environment , most of you anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . it &apos;s a big disadvantage .
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times more likely to buy a jar of marrow than if they had 24 choices .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient greek historian herodotus , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
but i think in this frame here , and with the intention of making something real , i &apos;m just going to just put the needle in there and go off the stage .
but for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the street in venice , my children were involved , my dog and we created this .
now , please lead all of these randomly chosen instructions , guide all the programs , and finally choose those who are next to me . &quot;
so i sent it home , i missed a quiet voice in myself trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
these are two very different units , the living self and memorizing self , and the two is part of happiness .
and after a very short period of time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species and completely converted into a new species based on the new software that we put into the cell .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you now think a director has to be a leader like a ship captain or something .
and as far as isolation goes , when we colonize as a species of distant planets , there will be isolation and the changes in the environment that evolution could produce in a natural way .
we &apos;re projecting that in 10 years , the rate of recognition of the civil rights is going to be as high as the rule of law .
and there &apos;s one generation that grew up on the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things in common , you just have to build systems .
we &apos;ve only brought phosphorus for two years , and we &apos;ve now been brought a lot more uranium mining around the world than it is used in all the nuclear plants .
that our system also has an award path , because we &apos;re going to do 20 percent with this el , and we &apos;re not going to go through the other things .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the aesthetics that you have in front of each other , because you have a job that you can &apos;t explain to any other .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not at all .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept was the idea of advertising to present your product as many people as possible , to make it as many people as possible .
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 varieties of ayahuasca , which you all recognize at great distance in the forest , which seems to be a kind of like this .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here , which you can rearrange and continue to rearrange and continue to rearrange , in any way .
and my love of science fiction appeared to reflect in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea .
this is a people who are not cognitively different between the colors of blue and green because the celestial scene is the forest that people depend on .
what do you think of the average performance of a cardiologist or a nurse or an orthopedic , a birthday shelter , should be a rescue ?
suppose you have a blind representation , and you become an operator whose average performance is 400 in terms of blindfold .
and there were the rare but painful charities of &quot; bad eye , &quot; and here they go , and they said , &quot; asians , go home . &quot;
i &apos;ve gone out of my comfort zone to know that , yes , the world is breaking apart , but not as you fear it .
and it was that there were self-administered alternatives , and one of them was sitting in cross in croszberg , where you thought evil was .
last month , i had the pleasure foundation to announce the so-called &quot; $ 10 million qualcomm tricorder . &quot;
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes something positive , as opposed to &quot; smell and humidity . &quot;
for memory itself , a two-weekly vacuum is hardly better than the one on vacuum , because there &apos;s no new memories to be added .
my call to anyone who &apos;s flying today is : imagine the same thing happening on your flight -- please don &apos;t -- but imagine if you didn &apos;t -- and how would you change ?
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t get the change , angry and inflexible , and troubled children , trapped between two worlds .
this was never before in the history of technology development , this kind of recursive growth , which is increasing the size of a few years .
i buffalo my father until finally he &apos;d made a school in buffalo , new york , finishing , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
there could be an actual , wonderful , bizarre , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the stranger , outrage thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
and second , we as a species , as a species , our environment , so that we managed to adapt to it to us , and we adapt to it .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside the window .
of course , the stories that i chose from the science-fiction area : &quot; terminator , &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
well , very briefly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we &apos;re not aware of the same things when we &apos;re thinking about life , and if we actually live .
and i went back through the same torture of shame and self-doubt , feeling relieved , and i went back to the work until it happened again and again .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
urgency optimism is desire to do something immediately , to master a hurdle , with the belief that we have a founded hope for success .

it &apos;s like these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and weird of quantum mechanics .
they were struck by the notion that people who had political power should have this political power , because of the bloodline from grandfather to son and so on .
she came from a man , an african-american , sympathetic , rau , homeless , who played on a violin who had only two strings .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how the people who use the things that we design .
i &apos;ve got some people counting the number of books that have been published with happiness in the title of the last five years , and they &apos;ve been published after about 40 , and there &apos;s a lot more .
armstrong twitter was about us and then , december , the time-magazine honored us when one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .

it &apos;s not just code for america , there are hundreds of people all over the country who are writing up and writing government apps every day in their own communities .
and in this scenario , imagine that in one case , the sperm is wearing a y chomosom that &apos;s hitting the x chromosome of the egg .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive and flourish is determined by the struggle of the human mind to change and flourish through conflicts .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static , stacked tiles to a world in which everything was interactive .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me , if you think about it , it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy it .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually just objects that are made in a small space .
i had to make sure that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to crush us , but it was over .
but it &apos;s usually until she reaches puberty and her breasts grow and develop , but she doesn &apos;t get her periodic until someone comes up with something else .
well , in our city where volunteers were supporting a high-qualified professional fire department , they have to be pretty early on to be able to be able to join .
and the deepest of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and mastery the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions ?
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everyone -- maybe most of the electronic health projects are missing : because we stopped listening .
now , with all of our digital devices that seven days a week , 24 hours a day of all this negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
and they do some tests , and they find out that instead of oiled and mother , in fact , she &apos;s wearing her and she &apos;s got an y chromosome .
no longer a building that would open up to make it , but a building that still breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump without being wet .
but tomorrow , it can change the challenges we have -- think about climate emissions or co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to the physical world .
the fellow riders for intractable objects are not just people , but also the light that appears to them and the wind that &apos;s missing from them and the heat of the room .
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i believe , believe it or not , from those adventures , i &apos;ve learned how to wear nothing new .
and we start by taking the garbage that already exists in these refrigerators or dry containers in the reactors . that &apos;s our starting fuel .
it requires that we all set our senses to the task , and that we use our thinking optimal thinking , like our emotions and our doing , in the challenge that we face .
and if you &apos;re playing with your particles , you &apos;ll find all kinds of weird things -- as you fly right through walls , or you can be in two different places .
and what &apos;s interesting is that this slide , like some of the others that we often meet in our field , are a kind of semi-logarithmic curve .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we have a 3.5 foot truck that needs to be under a three-foot bridge , and then you can kind of squeeze underneath it .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars is usually good for a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s going to buy my very personal shattering .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one , for example , is a scan of the library library , and it &apos;s in an area of 300 megapix .
all you have to do is look at the bitter numbers of really great minds from the 20th century , the young and often died by themselves .
the fact is that you &apos;re objectively looking at , the first time you had more information than the second time , but i would like to tell you that you felt it was real when the second time .

so , to put these theories , let &apos;s remember that it &apos;s definitely high-quality sabotage , it &apos;s got to be a high-quality goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because that &apos;s where most of the infections were reported .
this was a huge scream at the time , because , of course , you start manipulating the living language in the form of writing , which is what fluid and alive , i start and mice it in stone , and i manipulate it .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering on whether you should have this , if things come faster , or this innovation takes longer than we expect .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon i talked to a few years ago , who had brought some siamesian twins with him to separate them , partly to make a name .
what we &apos;ve learned from cross-cultural studies is that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- rather , complex social relationships and the fear of people who are vulnerable within the group are vulnerable to giving a lot of attention .
i think they were so tapestry and strong , and so radical , where what they were doing , that every few years , i tap into the malzily musical notation in 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .

now there are also things that are all over the day , but most people aren &apos;t aware of , for example , wagged enzymes that allow us to wash at 40 degrees of laundry , are also genetically optimized enzymes .
what children &apos;s doing differently is they start with the marshmallow and building prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so they multiple times the opportunity to repair bloodless prototypes .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute rights in terms of people , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden retriever , which probably deserves more than some people i know .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of problem-solving around the world , when we take the barriers of the next century , and the face of those who are facing all of us on the verge of an episode .
we believe that polemics -- we believe that poetry isn &apos;t persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website is getting 35 million apes every month .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal vents , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , and the science at the time we saw them , had never found any words .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy is growing up in italy with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is because i &apos;m going to show you , this is what happened in the formula 1 in the past few decades .
because i think that the interactive media in us are addressing archaic , cognitive models , thinking patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory very , very long time ago , and that we can just reproduce it through interactive media .
tan le , anonymous advocator of footscray , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , who was invited to places that she &apos;d never heard of , and in housing , whose existence she never imagined .
so we started with some volunteers that helped us , a little over a year ago , in seattle , to tag the things that they threw away -- different kinds of things that you could see -- things that you would throw away .
so this whole discussion of how is going to be moving and forth , energy use , like going to go , on the island , for example , we have 50 to 30 percent excess energy , so we have to run the wind and the sun .
the congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the shadow of a violent argument that &apos;s devastated for decades and almost as many lives as the first world war .
i &apos;m perhaps more interested in trying to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome wields , but that we &apos;re open to hug them to the hug , to put them on the verge , to use a fiddle expression and maybe even dance with it .
and it turns out that under a 60,000 dollar a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a 600,000 dollars a year of 600,000 dollars a year of 600,000 dollars a year of 600,000 dollars a year , but it &apos;s a year &apos;s worth of representative sample .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought of all the people i wanted to pass a hand and not do , all the fences that i wanted to flick , all the experiences that i wanted to do and never did .
if we change the plastics so that it can go back to biological systems , if we change the water storage , you can go back to cellulosic base , you can go back to a baby in israel or tunisia in israel or tunisia hundreds of trees .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and bags , just exploring and looking through ; immediately understandable ; characterized by sight ; and access to information , especially in terms of business spraying -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
would i take this assignment seriously , i would be born into a world that somebody like me would perceive as a person whose life could not be positive , but today i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the odds and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so , she runs to the house , looking for the paper , and the poem goes through her , and she grabs a pencil just as she goes through her , and then -- she said , &quot; it was as if she reached with her other hand , and she grabs it .
and i know some of you say , &quot; well , isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all talk to only one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be yoruba . let &apos;s be canadian .
and before the background , i set myself in the field of natural user interface design , so the next generation of human computers in which the relationship of the human computer is about how our tools , or how the computer is changing from the machine sukessive to the digital assistant .
coming out of the old tyrannian civilization populated the caribbean coast of colombia , and as a result of conquering , these people moved back to an isolated volcanic massive , rising across the caribbean coastal plain .
here you have this scensor between the most unconscious and the conscious who jumps immediately , without being able to do something about it , and the things that you know are very different , so that you can do something much better for you and others .
for example , there are anecdotes that the report of a captain of a captain so that this area of great fish promotion can &apos;t be used , or fishing scientists don &apos;t usually be used because it &apos;s not scientific .
you know , it &apos;s not just that people have to eat dog food when they go to retire , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , it also means making decisions are so hard that they miss big investment boats of their employers .

you &apos;re doing it for the task of will , the challenge will -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists . you &apos;re doing it for the discovery of space , and because of the weird connection that emerges when a small group of people form a team of people .
now , what you could do with the patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , and you could actually expand the reflection of the patient a mirror by just letting the tube go in there without shaking too much .
and if i take a step out and look at everything , i can rearrange my trajectory , maybe after my search past . here , i looked for &apos; nepotistic , &apos; here to bing , or here to live labs .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve made that the living self is worse off patient a bad turn , and you &apos;ve made that memory is much better off of patient a lot , because now you gave patient a better story on your experience .
that , as a translator , you transfer word to the text into a different language , you also have to understand the deeper meaning of words and the worsenic bias , so that there &apos;s a meaningful translation , everyone who knows to do with strangers .
so not only one farm that feeds its animals , not only one farm that measures its success in the health of their predators , but a farm that is literally a water supply plant , and not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
the great genetics in the 20th century , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a communicator in the russian orthodox church , once wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except in biology . &quot;
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there that are thermophil , and by doing the hot vapor , if fish were there , it would be vacuum fish , but they managed to make it a habitable environment for themselves .
what if you could change the sperm and the egg cells , or the freshing egg to give your kids a better chance of a healthier life -- eliminating diabetes , eliminating the crochet , reduce the risk of cancer ?
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people is convicted in general , but ethnocid , the destruction of the way people , not only is convicted , but generally and diverse as part of a developing strategy .
now , this could happen within the lifetime of an individual organism , whereas before the hundreds of thousands of years , because this information had to be learned from the individuals who died because of this fruit had not been there .
how many times have we chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we reject ourselves , and we expect the government , reflected our values and our needs , and then we don &apos;t change much ?
and of course , these sounds and this rhythm have represented the geology , the topography of an area , and of course , it also allowed you to defragment those songs and put them together , and move to the left , to the right and also to go back to the output .
i also think there are theories that are starting to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplistic story about it , which is that at that time , at that time , little oil droplet , which contain different kinds of recipes for chemicals .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why not perceive that at the bottom are only three fingers : because the mind and the way it processes information , it &apos;s not counting it , one , two , three , it &apos;s seen as a group .
and there was a time when there was only jeans in one way , and they bought them , and they missed them bad , they were incredibly incomprehensible , and if they wore long enough , and they washed enough , they started feeling &quot; ok . &quot;
now , what this thing does is it captures the lowering values of sensors -- like printing sensors and vibrational sensors -- and it provides legitimate code that &apos;s still available during the attack , with false data .
about an hour after she got home , after i finished her home , she collapsed and the family called 911 . the rescued her back to the emergency room with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous shock state .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform from the malayan coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the flavor of the first apple to give me one of the men on the platform .
how can these people from an 80,000 species of adjacent plants find these two morphologically unrelated plants that , when combined this , they create a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts ?
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that came out in the market recently , about how best we can do , is something that david laibson has been designed very strongly , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
at this point , the patients come into play . they can &apos;t just take control of control , be captain on their own ship , but they can also help us health care in terms of the challenges that are before us , and the cost of health , doubled demand , and so on .
it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is someone who &apos;s freaked him out when he &apos;s screaming up , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at branding when he &apos;s covered by a meter of snow .
and then there &apos;s a memory self , and the memory itself is that counting and receiving the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor addresses the question , &quot; how did you feel in the past ? &quot;
if you only allowed me one wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and that &apos;s what i love , or i could choose that wish , which is , half-biased energy , without co2 , and that desire comes from me .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to us . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all of these genes that we can eliminate one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so the tedtalk showed in a very simple form , that a charter city is a place whose beginning is uninhabited country , a founding contract that says the laws that exist there , and the people have the opportunity to decide to live under those rules or not .
we followed the geneaology eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked the people with pressures , they admitted that one of the people had become so old that he died because of his age , and we still killed him with the spear .
the people in the back , or those who see this later on , will say , &quot; well , this looks pretty impressive , but if it was real , he would -- look , this is a hole and there , if it was real , it would bleed . &quot;
now , as a result , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic stages , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he &apos;s disappearing around in the streets of skid row row row , always exposed to this horror and the torture of his own mind .
these older people come to me now and say , &quot; mr , stevenson , you talk , you &apos;re talking . you &apos;re telling people to stop saying that for the first time in the history of our nation , we have to do with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
and in this song , we will rediscover the possibility of being what we are : people with full consciousness who are aware of the importance that all people and gardens have to be able to thrive . and there are great moments of optimism .
so what you got was this : your name here is : my tedtalk , which you have no idea of what the subject is going to be , and which you can ever fly around your ears , especially if i was lying to your company for your participation .
there are some pilot projects that are creating this at a 60 percent level -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get it to 100 percent , and it &apos;s going to be a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the charge .
we worked with roberto bolle , one of the best ballet dancers in our time -- the étoe at the metropolitan theater in new york and the scala in mailand -- we took his movements in 3d to use it as impulse for the flyfire .
i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect for some time , and it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , unless you look at it the way i , as &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to be true if somebody believes enough . &quot;
so if you look at google glass , for example , this is an idea of what makes us recommend the virtual world with the real world , which is our monkey to virtual world , which is to recommend virtual as something normal , natural , is recommended .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t move between male and female , or female , or female and female , or female and sexually and sexually , we are the one that we present that line as a natural one .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by using the tricoder , and they &apos;re going to be trained by the khan-academic academy , and by having the ability to use 3d printer and infinite computing , and be much more productive than ever before .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like in iran , for example , where a man who feels sexually moved to other men , who feels sexually punished to death , unless he &apos;s willing to interfere with a gender transformation , in which case he can stay alive .
many companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- avoiding things where they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re going to avoid being scared , these elements , and that they will welcome them , and they actually turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a historical chess .
and maybe a little bit of view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have cyborg bodies to explore or do other things , in all kinds of post-humane future scenarios that i can think of as the science-fiction fan .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacuum that a couple of years ago in antarctica , who was clearly the best vacation i &apos;d ever had , and i think quite often think about how often i think about how often i think of other vacations .
the reason for this is , if i draw it to a normal curve , where , say , these are the years , so the timeline of a species , and this is an arbitrary measure of the technology that i want to present to a graph , then the graph will albern .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the idea of wealth that you bring to new elements into the game -- like the testes -- and also , as the game demands both trust and promotes -- while it &apos;s also fun at the same time .
i &apos;m going to describe to you a study that i did with gur huberman , eme kamenica , wei jang , where we looked at the decisions for the retirement of almost a million americans from about 650 places around the united states .

by playing music and talking about music , he was from this paranoid , confused man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a lovely , educated , educated , trained , trained , trained musicians .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the captive modern artist who tried to dominate this uncontrollable creative impulse that lived in him and to deal with them .
so where the founding fathers were extremely suspected to find out how individuals could be protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers into this concept , we could get more of a concept , not just how to protect , but how we can care for each other .
now , i like to be a little bit extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the toars of memories , but even if you make more of them , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight in the course of the weight that we give experience ?
you can imagine this cultural life web as an ethnosphere , and ethnosphere can be defined as the total amount of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspiration and intuitions that have been created by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
for the next couple of weeks , i went ahead and learned the first time i learned the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
she ran like the devil to the house as she was pursued by this poem , and it was all about she had to get to a leaf of paper and a pencil so that if she was donating through her , she could catch up and stick on the sheet .
and this curiosity also showed that when i was not in school , i was walking through the forests , and i collected samples , frogs and snakes and beetles and ponds and water , took it all home and looked under the microscope .
but there was only one company that was ready to help us -- and it &apos;s only because i know john bond and richard churning tree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with my team and go straight to the companies .
in fact , i set out the most part of my career to look forward to terrible situations , and all of this just for trying to look at social belonging and interesting , and hopefully in a way that it &apos;s fun for the audience and it &apos;s accessible and accessible .
another example : a few years ago , i received the phone call from a 19 year-old man who was born a boy , when he was young , he had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , and he had just figured out that he had eggs and had a mother .
he was driving at high speed when he suddenly hears a little fragment of a tune that , as it &apos;s often in inspiration for him , is agonizing for him , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s gorgeous . he likes it afterwards , but he can &apos;t touch it .
the leaders of the government in hduras are dependent on the aid of partnerships , they could benefit from their partnerships in which they could support the laws of this charter and the permission that everybody can trust that the charter is really performed .
this is an artistic institution , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers , and working with scientists and philosophers , working with scientists , trying to deal with these technologies and ask questions and creative , there are museum exhibitions , and yes , all kinds of things .
now , not exactly what i hoped to do , but i went down -- the stairs , down the hallway , the &quot; real firemen , who , at that point , at that point , had already been done pretty much to get into the bedrooms to get some shoes . &quot;
with complete transparency , what the new thinking is , what the old thinking is , what bangs on the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the lasagne horse and no beef is more or other phenomena , which is , i want to just flip this up and do not want to do it .
in my 20-odd years of medical sensus and journalism , i made a personal medical study on medical errors and wrong treatments to learn all kinds of things that i could do for the toronto star to my show &quot; white coat , &quot; white coat . &quot;
and where you can see how far away we are , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , that we are on earth , you can see that , for example , openbach has a program , up to 20 , you want to be climax , right ?
these may be a state-of-the-art contribution , and if you do better than i expect , that would be great , but my point here is that we have to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they shoot us , because they all have significant problems .
at others , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house , and the poem rolled through her , and she missed it . she said it would go on over the country , and as she said -- he would look for another poet .

they sum up the out-of-print co2 that leads to temperature rises , and that temperature increase has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather and maybe worse , the indirect consequence that the natural ecosystems cannot adapt to such rapid changes and fall together whole systems .
not through the latest mighty and tractor inventions , but through frustrating land , not by pumps , but through fresh water , not by chain seawater , but by the forests , and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
feet of herbivores of herbivores , skull bats for monocultures , chemicals to the earth , chickens of fish , and all the time the agrarian industry just wondered , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can it be ? &quot;
and problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , but it can just be an underlying problem , which is just a simple problem , and how do you do it differently , and how do you do it differently , or how do you do it better .
and they simulated wind and the sun and the burden and came to the conclusion , a very exciting outcome , which is that , after the conventional system that takes you to have a middle-aged circuit of about 50 cents a kilowatt-hour .
and he looked at me one day at one of my practices -- these practices were just humbling and gnadening -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to crude one day of these benches .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more and more , that if you &apos;re ready to narrow , and the insignificant opportunities are going to get rid of it , well , there &apos;s an increase in sales of sales , it &apos;s going to be healed , r &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an improvement in decision perception .
a continent is always released , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious faith . of course , there was one , and voodoo is simply the remaining of this very profound religious thought that during the tragic diaspora of slavery time .
and that &apos;s when you all enjoy your emotions about politics and the snake at work and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about is government , in the core , in the words of tim o &apos;rilly , &quot; what we do in common about . &quot;
but the process and the heavy glue that surrounds him was lifted when he took the genius out of himself , where he didn &apos;t have to be an anger and let him go back to where he came from . he realized it didn &apos;t have to be an internal , agonizing thing .
this peculiar event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called kit , pray , love -- that , unlike all of my previous books for some reason , went out to the world and became a big mega-event , international polar thing .
but in fact , you &apos;d thought about it for a long time , but you could never simulate whether it was going to work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yes ! with the right materialistic approach , it looks like it works .
but it &apos;s going to find 17 brand partners who were willing to negotiate this control that we wanted to do with someone who wanted to do as mindful and negotiate as i did , and that eventually enabled us to tell stories that we couldn &apos;t usually have told -- stories that would never support an advertisement .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to 70-percent renewable , and then we &apos;re still left with this rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very , very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work out of batteries .
this seems to me , first of all , so i repeat it , so i repeat it can work out : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
because we have this self-deception , this feeling of being great , desperation of the highest nature , not from one such natural level , of something that &apos;s unpredictable as an organism that exists , comparable to a rock and other things , it &apos;s unsustainable for us .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that mimic the problem of decision-making -- limits -- they &apos;re going to get rid of the excess alternative ; concrete -- make it real ; categorize -- we can do better with more categories , less possibilities ; prepare in complexity .
in our desire to protect the people that we care about , and to share the cold , hard truth about their medical forecast , or even provide a forecast of life that they expected , we have to pay attention that we don &apos;t have the foundation for somebody to actually be disabled .
and what we &apos;ve done is actually using a new kind of network that &apos;s been used around the world -- this is a mobile phone network -- and anonymous and aggregated information from this network that &apos;s being collected from the operator to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance came and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all gods and mysteries . and there &apos;s no room for mystical creatures embracing command from divine .
but we don &apos;t even know if we listen to someone like this , because we know this kind of statement for so long , and somehow we have the notion of creativity and collective acceptance that , in some sense , creativity and suffering , somehow -- always leads to the soul .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the convenience of the life of an unknown precedented -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , every one of their days , by telling each other &apos;s stories and slept , we &apos;re still in the same bed .
he was talking in a very healthier and gregarious note about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers would never make it into the baseball world series , and all of this because of the thoughtful passage of beethoven &apos;s first spike in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
whenever we think of innate and landscape , we either call rousseau and the old ruousseau of noblings , which in its simplification , is a rapid thought , or the other hand , reau and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
and if you chose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self , and you have to think about how you decide that conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think about time , you get an answer . and if you think about memories , you might have a different answer .
and then i tried this in my lab to expand a little bit , and then i bought myself so second-hand equipment on ebay and did a little bit d.n.a analysis , trying to do a father test , so / so / d.n.a fingerprinting to go home .
now , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the difficult situation of embodied , look at them as orginitially and colorful , but somehow confined them to the past , while the real world is progressing .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could still tell you a lot more about this , and tell the many other wonderful things that you can do with perceive , but i &apos;d like to talk to you about the second part that we discussed at the beginning , and that &apos;s the concrete of our environment .
but in 2011 , if you buy a new color laser printer from the leading laser printing factories , and print one page , that page of helle yellow blobs on each page , in a pattern that clearly leaves the page to you and your printer .
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it means at the end of the hammer and threw it down to moses -- in fact , you can still see a little spot below -- and he said , &quot; perché non parli ? why don &apos;t you stretch ? &quot;
it would be great if we could take this pattern of normal thinking about another possibility or strength to even challenge it a little bit more dangerous , to exchange it . so we can release the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their special and valuable skills into society .
this is , if you focus a laser beam , on a space , you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then move in this focus , which is , you know , it &apos;s captured there , like a tractor beam .
the neolithic revolution that brought us agriculture , and at that moment , at this moment of the seed of the saatcorn , replaced the poetry of the shame of the priest of the priesthood and hierarchy , specialization and shooting -- it was only 10,000 years ago .
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down on friday . everybody &apos;s upside down , weekend , weekend . friday , friday . friday , friday . you didn &apos;t think we were going to have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
i think a significant -- not the only , but a significant contribution to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the disappointment because their standards are so high . and then if they have to explain these experiences themselves , they think it would be their fault .
if i show you 600 magazines , and you split it up in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and i &apos;ll share it in 20 categories , and you believe that i gave you more choice and a better choice experience than i would have given you the 400 of them .
this works really , this is done in academic scale , and we thought , &quot; okay , we might get there , we might have taken a webcam that &apos;s screaming down the lens , turning the lens , flipped around , you have a microscope that &apos;s going to scale up about four hundred times .
bill gates : in order to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million . and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it works reasonable , you &apos;re only in the 100th million .
i mean , most of the moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve calculated this -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds , which means , in a life , there are about 600 million of them in a lifetime . in a month , there are about 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave any trace .
the first thing , when you get to be a baby , is that you take care of what kind of divorce you have , right ? and depending on whether your parents allowed you to play more or less in the pitch , the more , you know , your curiosity is bent .
there are 175 dressessings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different extra olive oil and 12 balsamico that you could buy to make a big number of your own salat dessessings in which unlikely that none of the 175 is right in the store for you .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we microsoft as part of an exception just a year ago . this is seadragon . and it &apos;s an environment where you can either go locally or distant with vast amounts of visual data .
and that was really , really bitter , and then you get in this kind of phase , and you just kind of get into a picture of where i was asking myself , after 10 years , a thousand mark was that , you know , at that time , basin , of course , collectively , whether it &apos;s really supposed to be that great .
a group of ankara , who i met a while ago , who was a student group of students who wanted to communicate more to the public what they &apos;re learning in college , and they were doing in such a street feast , and they were trying to explain to people what is d.n.a .
i was reading this list to a friend , and i had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i just came up to &quot; and i couldn &apos;t speak anymore , and i had to stop reading , and i had to stop reading and raise me after this flooding wordless emotional shock .
and the insight of president lobo is that the certainty of the translation that i thought of as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build this city could be equally significant for all the parties in honduras who have been afraid and suspicion for many years .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 that you want to get to zero , and it &apos;s going to depend on the number of people who are using the average energy on average energy for every service and the co2 that &apos;s emitted per unit of energy .
and then just came from the do-it-yourself bio org website of the founders , and he said o.k , we have to really meet each other , real , and then organized two sessions , one in london , two thousand , and just after that in the u.s. , san francisco .
and s o , with this premise , with this premise , for example , brian degger in england tried to put together a minimum wage together , took a steam printing , a hot plate , and , yes , so soup breaks , and then it grew bacteria .
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of desperation in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all existing specific ones have succeeded in evolutionary terms of success : they have survived ; it has demonstrated its environment of fitness and strength .
this was the most surreal form of a déjacku i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i bog around a corner , i &apos;ve always known what was going to appear in the light of the vehicles of the vehicle for months , because i &apos;d run over the film set when we turned the movie .
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo acolyths in a trash state , the glowing coal without combustion , an amazing illustration of the ability of the mind to influence the body in such that it stops when it &apos;s displaced into a state of extremes .
&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; what my friends call at autodesk &quot; infinite computing , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printer , which allows us to democratize personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , fuels and food , digital medicine , nano-materials and artificial intelligence .
and from a conversation this morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of the do it yourself , i want to share something with you -- he gave me permission -- his technology called the slingshot , which many of you may have already heard of . it &apos;s the size of a refrigerator at the student home .
but we wanted to go even further . we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome . it had over 580,000 letters of genetic code , so we thought we could build it in cassette tape from the size of the virus that we could varied the size of the virus that we could varied the size of the cassets to understand what the individual component of a living cell is .
i had to repeat individual practices sometimes repeatedly repeatedly with these thickness , elastic bars -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscles . and i hated them more than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think that we have to go back hundreds and hundreds of years before the enlightenment to find a time when we fought progress in which we &apos;ve been struggling to get more frontiers than we have now .
if i went to a room full of colleagues , and i would ask your immediate support and tell you what i &apos;ve just told you , i &apos;m not going to reach the end of the second story before it really uncomfortable , somebody would hide a joke , they would change the subject and forget the rest .
so by combining color , contrast and brightness to the edges of the individual images , photography men , how rock depth , disconnected colors and disorders , we get the boundaries between the different images , and let them look like a single photograph , even though a picture is basically able to contain hundreds of levels .
the nice thing about this is , if you do this , you make agriculture , biogas , on a hectare country , with five thousand inhabitants in favelas , you can produce about a thousand dollars of crops and wait for the plant , chicken and picks and vegetables and vegetables and fishes and vegetables .
if you ever have the chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program -- in fact , do you all -- you &apos;ll see that the people who call government for many different problems , including that a marrow is in your house .
you know , one of the great notions about traveling and one of the pleasures in ethnography is to live with the people who still remember the old days . the past is still feeling in the wind , touching them from the rainfall , touching them by the rainfall , tasting them in the bitter leaves of the plants .
you all know the healthy shame when you give a secret to the best friend &apos;s best free prize , even though that one &apos;s swamed on disappear , and you get caught up and the best friend confronts you with it , and it leads you a terrible discussion when you end up at the end of the bad conscience , and you sweep that you never make a mistake .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , say , two mirror reflections at two different surgeons and decides what to choose , then the one who has chosen the memory is less miserable , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s going to choose .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic economic economic , and at the same time , the skeptics say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in it emitting co2 , i wished that it did , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question and answering session after one of my lectures that reported a story . &#91; unclear ... &#93; he said he would have heard a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music , and at the end of the recording , there was a terrible circular sound .
you know ? i think allowing a mere person to think he &apos;s thinking , or she &apos;s like the pot and the essence and the source of divine , creative , unknown , infinite mysterious mysterious mysterious mystery is a little too much responsibility to soar them up to a fragile human psyche .
i &apos;m probably hearing the two nice girls still there , and i &apos;m probably one of the generation who &apos;s been looking for this bad oko image , because i &apos;m going to go to 10,000-odd already started studying machine construction in karlsquiet , technical high school today , which is , i think , kit .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which should shoot the latte in things of visual effects and computer-generated effects in a whole new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters that were made using cg . and the main characters should all be cg . and the world should be cg . and the world should be cg .
so the fact is that in the 20th century , in 300 years , you won &apos;t remember for your wars or technical innovations , but rather than an era in which we were against and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth , either active or passively accepted . so the problem is not the change .
i was afraid , not mine , but i was afraid that i could lose him , that he could drop him in one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to the violin when i started talking about pitches and arpeggio and other exciting forms of didacegogics and other exciting forms of didacity .
now , you need , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this one -- something that car overwaits in real time , has a few thousand sensors , the information from the car , pass that information to the system , and then you process it and then you use it to send back to the car decisions and change things in real time .
what &apos;s interesting historical footnote : when the pokes soup came up with this practice . the language changed over the course of the centuries , allah , allah , allah , allah , olé , olé , olé , that you &apos;re still struggling and flamenco dancing .
so , in a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro , we did a study with the people at dressing -- employees who all worked for dressing -- and these people were all in a gathering collection where they signed their participation for their retirement plan .
if i want to close with you today , it &apos;s that the total of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about information overlap , i want you to think about how we can use information , that patterns are coming in , and we recognize trends that would otherwise not be visible .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature that was believed that it was literally living in the walls of an artist -- sort of like dobby , the house -- the came out and the artist at work in a certain way that would be invisible and created the outcome of the work .
we also have one of those same aggregate in the same size that it &apos;s standing there , in the halle , in fact , the full dynamic behavior of this network , so in the hall , it looks like this , there &apos;s the big battery in the back of this el , and here &apos;s the big battery , and here &apos;s the whole readers that we &apos;re simulating the net .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of writing process , pray , love -- i fell into one of those pellets of the doubt that we all fall when we &apos;re working on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start to think it &apos;s going to be a disaster . this becomes the worst book that &apos;s ever written .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , the burden of the burden of responsibility for someone who knows something -- namely the doctor -- to someone who knows nothing and is most likely to be sick , and therefore not in the best constitution is to make a decision -- namely the patient .
and if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen before , you &apos;re also going to understand why ninety-nine percent of our software today is slightly more intuitive or not based on the phone , the i-pad in many areas or i-phone , although it &apos;s already much more intuitive than classic software .
the computer vision algorithms have been holding these pictures together to the real space , where these images all came close to the grassi lakes in the canadian rockies , and you can see elements of stabilized dias or panoramic imaging , and these things have been all reluctant to each other .
bg : now we haven &apos;t set ourselves up in a place yet , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting open rules for everything that &apos;s called the nuclei . there &apos;s a big interest and the people of the corporate in russia , india , china ... i was here and i met the energy agenda .
not a biologist would say , for example , 50 percent or more of all species are about to extinct , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the apocalyptic scenarium in the area of biodiversity -- is almost what &apos;s known to us as the most optimistic scenario in the area of cultural diversity .
down here in the picture , you can see , the lab , in leadership , so a garage with all kinds of laboratories that uni did , which is a group in paris , which has set up , and it &apos;s pretty successful with it , and it &apos;s doing pretty interesting things , and i want to cut a project in paris that &apos;s going to take a long time .
i recommend all of you to read steves book , or to look at the movie , so that you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connection that came from between these two men , but also how the music helped create that connection , and how it ended up with the instrument when the instrument was allowed to get the mithalf , nathaniel way out of the street .
and if i translate this now , for example , in which i orient as an overview , selecting as a choice , informed in the trap , it comes up to me , i can look at it in detail , and yes , transfer it , i can either throw it down or buy it anywhere .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people are always asking me to tell you about how to deal with widrills , and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this sentence never missed for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable answering the questions of people , and i think , well , i think , well , why .
in the early 80s , i got a really amazing job when my professor at harvard asked me if i was interested in going to haiti and infiltrate the secret societies that were the foundation of duvalier and clay macoutes and the poison that was used to make zombia safer .
so i went home and ate with my wife at night and told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a second time , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use his eyes to control things , then we should find a way that tempt can control a laser , so that &apos;s great . &quot;
and so there are different , but the nice thing about this is that an uranium molecule has a million times as much energy as one , say , a cow molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and that &apos;s mostly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , the potential , so the impact on land and other things , almost in your own league .
so we have this kind of situation where , as we continue to continue our science , we have to admit to more , that these categories that we thought were stable anatomic categories that made very simple advertisers to create permanent identification categories are much less than we thought .
over the past year , i &apos;ve been looking for models for doing this , and i &apos;ve also been looking for it , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies , to see if they might have better or more sensible ideas about it than how to help creative deal with the emotional risks associated with creativity .
this , of course , was just a simple trick by dr. p. so i do the practices that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that the richest five-year-old girl at the hospital ward , but he actually brought me to see my daily practice horror horror with new eyes , so it became a new and promising experience .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best proteins folder in the world , it wasn &apos;t a mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a caltech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working on the day as an assistant at the time of business in a reha-clinic and at night , who was the world &apos;s best proteins ordnesday .
this revenue of dealing with widrilling lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on mastering a challenge without being coined by the interconnected experience . as if my life had gone so successful , because i could expand the possible fall of a prosthetic life , or whatever people perceive me with my disability .
really , some happy people and companies , for-profit and non-profits , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson &apos;s never going to leave that -- to buy the nameless rights in the talk that you &apos;re just seeing , which at the time didn &apos;t have a title or much content , and not many evidence of what the subject would actually be .
bruce brown , a well-known researcher at the brighton university , has gone so far to say that these mass media , he says the book and the image , so not television , the internet and so on , what we call mass media today is that these mass media memorized our memories and our ability to virtualize our ability .
and now , just in a direction of biology , and i want to take this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because , the d.n.a code is an abstract code , which is , it &apos;s not quite the same as computers , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , and it &apos;s real matter , and it &apos;s not just cyber .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering the draper prize for francis arnold and willem stemmer , two scientists who developed independently developed the natural process of evolution to work faster and lead desirable proteins in an efficient way -- what frances call &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
that made me think of another person as my friends under the kwakiutl , who believe that these forests are contains of hukuk and the boomed celestial and the cannibalic spirits that live in the northern of the world , spirits that would be involved in their hamatch-initiation .
and they got two builders set up there , and they said , &quot; o.k , we make it simpler and cheaper , and then we just made out of open source , so available hardware , electronics things that have assembled this device , and now they have brought it to market drill , and they are now the cheapest supply of these devices in the world . &quot;
woman parks used to come back to montgomery , where she was wearing two of her oldest friends . these older women , johns who organized the montgomery-bus boykott -- an incredible african-american -- and virginia durr , a white whose husband , clifford , dr. king .
these people have come online , but they have acquired it illegal by using trojans to clap money out of our bank accounts while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or keyloggers , who are collecting our credit card information on the board , while we &apos;re buying our online banking information online .
and that would be your answer to the bjordan lomborg argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffer , the poverty reduction , the fight of malaria and so on , that there &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest money while there are better things that we can do .
my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming up , and i thought to myself , because i &apos;m here with friends , i would tell you what i really think . and also try to look back and understand what &apos;s really going on here , with these incredible springs that are happening so fast that we can hardly mite .
it means that a small child from the angles growing up in the belief that the mountain is an apu-spirit that his or determines her fate , will become a very different person , and have a different relationship to this resource , or this place , as a young child from montana growing up in the belief that a mountain is a bunch of rocks that can be discarded .
i had such an encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who is now over 90 , but her whole life denser . she told me that when she was in the villages of virginia , she was working out on the fields of virginia , and she said she could feel and hear a poem about the landscape .
if one didn &apos;t say no , the vetophicist , it was completely grueling you . i spent 10 years trying to doubled if i could , you know , you know , maybe , you know , you know , because all the colleagues of my father always agreed to talk to him , you missed the money off the window at your kid .
in other words , sugar pills in some studies have shown a measurable effect , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what happens to her is a pharmaceutical or a kind of ... in pain management , for example , there are , if the patient believes enough , a measurable effect in the body they call the placebo effect .
i &apos;d like to just show you one of the original dates of noah , and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first worked in summer to show you what i think is really the punch behind this technology , which is photosynth technology . and this is not necessarily so obvious if you look at the environments that we have on the website .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that , as we move towards a fade , unraveled , generic worldview , we &apos;re not only going to see the entire bandwidth of the human imagination in a uniquely minded way , but that one day we have forgotten from a dream , and we &apos;ve forgotten that there &apos;s ever been other possibilities .
we cleaned the chromosome of the microbes of a microbial species . in general , these two are as far apart as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to choose that chromosome . we cut it down with enzymes to destroy all the proteins . and it was very amazing as we put it into a cell -- and they will appreciate our very sophisticated graph here .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of urgent problems , to invest in something that you have later -- and that &apos;s not so clear . in fact , the ipcc report isn &apos;t necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world who are looking at ipcc and saying , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
i went to lhasa with a young colleague , 6,000 miles from chengdu in west china from southeast tibet , and only when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics you hear . 6,000 sacred monuments that were transformed into shock and ashes . 1.2 million people who were murdered during the cultural revolution .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we set people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted to death , 11 times higher if the victim is white , when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher , if the ambitious black and the victim knows -- in the same state in which the body is soynter people .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral notre lady , who was only happening in the computer with images of flickr . just give notre lady in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the university camps and so on . each of these orange kets represent a picture that was discovered as this model .
so let &apos;s take a step back to the time of the big bang 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first indication of creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-cellular organisms , maybe so much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species that ultimately forms in the last 130,000 years .
and to show you the dimension , i looked at all kinds of batteries that are being made , looking at cars , computers , cell phones , flashlights , for everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been using the amount of electronic energy that the world uses . i &apos;ve found that all the batteries that we &apos;re producing now producing , less than 10 minutes of total energy .
a few years ago , the laser prize for the scientist shinya yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cells , a fibrocist , and through the manipulation of only four genes that industrialized cell to take them back to a pluripotent stem cell -- a cell potentially could be able to become any cell in your body .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to switch off your hearing machine , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn shoultz &apos;s book , which is about to be wrong , because nothing else in this talk will make sense for you .
when you go back to the country and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the screaming , and the whole thing around , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human performance , if you work on lake , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to others . it &apos;s like police officers or soldiers who have done something in common and know that they can never explain it to anybody .
in my show , &quot; white coat , black art . &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about her ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show the microphone .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and who are involved in nasa , and in nasa , and plan real space missions . they go to russia , and they go through the mission of biomedical protocols , and they go to the international space station , and they go through the mission of the biomedical protocol .
now we all use , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly widely distributed in total alitarian states like iran , where dissidents use like gmail , because they know that they can trust them more than local , and that they &apos;re encrypted to be encrypted , so that the local government can &apos;t sniff around their conversations .
for example , women who were using the right to vote , the concept of founding fathers , which is that anatomical commonality is more important than the anatomic difference , and said , &quot; that we have a utero and egg sticks and eggs are not important enough that we should not have the right to own citizenship , the right to ownership , the right to ownership , etc . &quot;
many of you will know the story , because of steves articles became a book later , which was filmed with robert downey junior when steve lopez and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony ayers , who was a convenient who studied at juilliard-conservatory , and whose promising career was sent early on by his paranoid schizophrenia .
i even had my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who introduced the psychedelic urea with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the &apos; 30s , discussed it . i would argue that you couldn &apos;t hire those tryptamins as a hallucination in mexico , because the moment you feel the impact you &apos;re not there to experience a hallucination .
so the system develops to make bakups , which make it easier for people like me to make mistakes that people inevitably make , and it also enables lovely to create supportive , supportive spaces that anyone watching health care , can actually address things that are potential mistakes and even reward them for people like me , and especially for people like me who make mistakes and should be rewarded for the gratification of those rewards .
it &apos;s not a lot of space for it in the malaria shrinking of asmat or the cold winds of tibet , but still , through time and ritual , formed a mysterious nimbus on earth , which is not based on the idea of being aware of it , but on a far more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because it &apos;s embedded in the human consciousness .
a huge story , of course , but again , we have the problem of a growing company , and then we have two thousand , a small group , decided that we start to go back small and dedicate to the next topic of the future , and that &apos;s what i think it &apos;s so crazy again , that &apos;s when people say , it &apos;s going to say , &quot; well , it &apos;s all about to say , &quot; well , this is not what is all about , we &apos;re talking about storing . &quot;
if someone &apos;s taken the cows , and they &apos;ve labeled all of these sacred holy and they &apos;re all , then my photo will come from the notre dam cathedral suddenly sucked with all this data , and i can use it as a starting point of diving into this room , into these metaverse , using photos of other people , and so i can use it as a kind of out-of-the-box model social experience from other people .
i want to end with a poem that was captured by a persian poet named hafiz in the 14th century , and my friend jacques bois . and the poem is , &quot; the god who knows only four words . &quot; every child knows god , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , but the god who only knows only four words , and he says , &quot; all the time , he said , &quot; come on with me . &quot;
the young acolyths are separated at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a shadowy world of finstar , stone hubs on the verge of the glacier for 18 years , two periods of nine years , selected to mimic the nine months of the pregnancy that they spent in the lap of their millennial mother , they now spend metamorphanish in the great mother .
at this point , jafour said to octavio said , &quot; what happens if we take an uncanadian area of our country -- what if we just took it to an embassy part of the american embassy -- part of the canadian bottleneck , and if people want to go to work under the canadian rules , or the united states , can you work there , and can you work there , and can you do everything you usually have to go to canada or america ? &quot;
so , i &apos;d like to summarize this in the sense that the qualities and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the vocal age , and that we &apos;ve gone a little bit of a shame in the machine age that the so-called cyber age can be activated , and that , in this way , we can be activated with complex , new products , not actually into the future , but to come back to us .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interactions with real objects -- along with my professional , patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi , i started to wonder : what if we used computers that , instead of using a mouse cursor that moves like a digital fingertip on a flat floor -- what if we could intervene with both hands and physical data , and we could attack it physically , how could we want it ?
